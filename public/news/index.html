<p><span class="drop">I</span>n a glimpse, being in line along the rosters of National Artists, which is considered as the highest recognition in the discipline of arts might only cursor through honor and prestige. However, the thing that should be magnified in this august title is how the scope of influence is boundless.  F. Sionil José is widely acknowledged as part of  the Philippines’ National Artist in Literature, bestowed by his works that reflect nationalism, anti-elite notions and social underpinnings of colonialism and class struggles which are still relevant at this time.</p>
<p>It is now an open secret how this administration imposed record-high numbers of killings and acts of oppression to the critics and progressives. In the recent tally of the National Union of Journalists in the Philippines (NUJP), the country has recorded 19 murders, 37 libel cases, 52 intimidation cases, 20 online harassment cases since the Duterte administration began to reign. In line with this horrific scenario, the apparency of both suppression and oppression is more than obvious. Being a figure of expression, F Sionil Jose made statements that revealed how he must be a genius of FICTION. The operative words to begin, fiction.</p>
<p>In a column for the Philippine Star titled, <a href="../independence-sionil-jose/">Independence</a>, José claimed with aplomb that Duterte is the next gold of the country&ndash;analogizing to the former president, Ramon Magsaysay. Without reluctance, he was able to hastily justify the president’s foul language and his distorted idea of “best” ruling. This belies the dreadful state of activism and progression, which the Commission on Human Rights described as the “worst state” of press freedom after the country downgraded from 136th to 138th rank in 2021 World Press Freedom Index.</p>
<p>Amidst the controversial shutting down of ABS-CBN where censures went through the roofs, it was shocking how  José’s justified this sudden termination of the country’s largest media network. He wrote a “requiem” stating that he sympathized with the number of Filipino families who lost their jobs but he assured that he will never mourn with ABS-CBN shutdown.  Unhesitatingly, he ended his requiem by stating that “The Filipinos do not really need ABS-CBN”. His profound approval to the discontinuity of the network was catalyzed by his personal hate towards the oligarchs of the people. Alongside shutting down a media outfit, it ramified 11,000 workers to lose their jobs, but a body of expression which ought to defend the freedom of expression, had weaponized his power to cheer up in this horror.</p>
<p>If one thing is more dreadful than the rest, is how José phlegmatically stated that the country during Duterte’s governance is “far safer now”. The unforgettable bloodshed of the extra-judicial killings caused by Duterte’s war-on-drugs, the high-rise number of killings of media practitioners, peasant activists and progressives- these are just the few of the many contradictions on how it is possible for a public figure to call out country “safe”. The fear cuts deeper and deeper as the 2020 Social Weather Station reveals that 65 percent of Filipino adults believe that it is fearful to publish any print or broadcast critical takes against the administration even if it’s the truth.</p>
<p>John Pablo Salud, a fellow book author vented out his disappointment on how José’s consistent reliance on the government is still unwavered despite the current reports of media killings and progressives repression. To be fair, it was also stated by Salud that  José’s factors of aging and mental capacities are weakening due to suffering from dementia. These details were put into consideration why  José is still an avid believer of this administration. However,  Salud stated  that “when people are being murdered, siding with the executioners is not a matter of debate”. Foremost, it is beyond “catastrophic” to realize how an influential body of Arts, which seemed to be an undying discipline especially today, is still choosing to shut their unquestionable ability to call out and influence.</p>
<p>Art is the ultimate form of expression. It is saddening to know that a representation of Filipino art is enabling a fascist to retrograde the country’s freedom of speech and entitlement of opinions.  José being earmarked as a genius of fiction must have been the best label. Everything he consistently believes in seems so unreal to take. However, the lives taken and identities harassed were not products of just mere imagination and no flowering words nor understatement can sugarcoat this trepidation- this is the real state of the country.</p>
<p>Localizing more the significance of why this needs to be called out,just imagine the number of educators who look up to these national figures as inspirations to teach the youth. Domino effect it must be, being one of the pioneers of arts is more than the title itself but the accountability it holds. It is very undeniable how educators can be also a subject of enabling fascism. It is very undoubtful how this influence of supporting a fascist translates over huge personalities just like Harry Roque, a former law professor. A pill that is hard to swallow, not everyone who educates, is truly educated.</p>
<p>Starting from a normal scenario, when educators refuse to hear the appeals and opinions of their students up to the fact that many professors are still in their stand to support this government. A learning setting should guarantee a learner’s feeling of safety, but up to this day professors who neglect political opposition and critics do not guarantee a secured learning environment.  It was stated by  José the notable quote that “the influence of teachers extends beyond the classroom well into the future”. He spoke for himself and his massive influence together with the power of an educator to impact a learner- now it boils down to what kind of influence that is translated with their stands.</p>
<p>It seems confusing, what is more unsettling, is the fact that a National Artist enables a fascist which serves an utter irony to how he views himself as an anti-dictator and his works defying anti-elite views or how his scope of influence can even transcends through educators and professors that are disposed in nurturing the youth? Truth to tell, degree and prestige is sometimes weaponized to stay in privilege and the fact that they are benefiting in this fascist system. No one questions the ability of F. Sionil José as a prolific writer,  his  to write in excellence nor the capability of educators to teach. The question here, to whom they dedicate their excellence in their fields- to the masses? or to the silencers of the masses. This comes across the thought that education equates no actual learning when one uses it to only benefit oneself.</p>

<p><span class="drop">U</span>maabot ng 365 na araw upang maganap ang rebolusyon ng mundo sa araw. Isang taon mahigit ang lumipas nang kumalat ang COVID-19 sa Pilipinas, ngunit ang mga pangyayari ay bumabalik pa rin sa simula, tulad ng proseso ng rebolusyong pabalik-balik at hindi matapos-tapos.</p>
<p>Dahil sa pagsasawalang-bahala sa pagsipat sa tunay na problema at kakulangan ng konkretong plano ng rehimeng Duterte sa pagsugpo sa krisis pangkalusugan buhat ng COVID-19, muli’t muli lamang napipilayan ang kabuhayan ng masang Pilipino.</p>
<p>Mula nang sumipa ang  kaso ng COVID-19 sa bansa, dalawa sa sampu o 17.7% ng mga Pilipino ang unemployed. Ayon sa Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), ito ang pinakamataas na unemployment rate sa loob ng nagdaang 16 na taon.</p>
<p>Nitong nakaraan lamang, nagbigay ang DSWD ng P4,000 na ayuda kada pamilya para sa mga nasa Greater Manila Area na  isinailalim muli sa ECQ. Sa kabila nito, marami ang dumaing na hindi sapat ang ayuda sa mamamayan buhat ng kapabayaan at kapalpakan ng restriksyon sa pagbubukas ng ekonomiya sa kabila ng sinusunod na quarantine protocols. Nababagabag ang mamamayan sa patuloy na pagtaas ng presyo ng mga bilihin at bayarin habang mababang pasahod hanggang sa kawalan ng kabuhayan kaya’t lugmok sa kagutuman ang mga Pilipino.</p>
<p>Base sa pagsusuri ng PSA, nito lamang Pebrero umabot na sa 4.6% ang inflation rate sa presyo ng mga bilihin sa bansa. Ngayong tag-init, kasabay ng  pagtaas ng konsumo sa tubig at kuryente ay tiyak din na malaki ang bayarin dito.</p>
<p>Hindi maikakaila na mayroong mga nananawagan na taasan ang halaga ng ayudang ipinamamahagi kada pamilya sabay rin ang pagsasabatas ng “livable wage” sa bansa.</p>
<p>Sa kabila nito, isinaad ni Pangulong Duterte noong nakaraang taon na wala nang pera ang bansa at wala na itong kakayahang mamahagi ng pagkain at pera sa mga mamamayan.</p>
<p>Marso ngayong taon, pormal nang itinaas ng Makabayan Bloc ang House Bill 9089 na P10,000 ayuda sa Kongreso. Nakalahad sa naturang batas na nararapat na makatanggap ng P10,000 ayuda ang mga Pilipino sa loob ng dalawang magkasunod na buwan.</p>
<p>Ngunit kalabisan nga bang maituturing ang P10,000 ayuda?</p>
<h3 id="sa-mata-ng-masang-manggagawa">Sa mata ng masang manggagawa</h3>
<p>Para kay Ericka Jane Valderamos, isang Iskolar ng Bayan at work-from-home call center agent sa isang BPO company sa Cainta, Rizal, malaki ang maitutulong ng P10,000 ayuda bilang pantustos sa arawang gastusin.</p>
<p>Itinuturing na breadwinner si Valderamos ng kanilang pamilya sapagkat siya ang panganay sa anim na magkakapatid.</p>
<p>Naisipan niyang magtrabaho habang nag-aaral upang makatulong sa lumalaking gastusin kasabay pa ng pagtaas ng presyo ng mga pangunahing bilihin.</p>
<p>Resulta ng kasalukuyang pandemya ang paghina at kawalang kita ng maliit na <em>canteen</em> ng kanyang ama sa palengke malapit sa kanilang tirahan sa siyudad ng Pasig.</p>
<p>Dagdag niya, walang <em>dine-in</em> sa kanila bagkus puro take-out na lamang batay sa umiiral na <em>guideline</em> ng modified enhanced community quarantine sa NCR+ bubble.</p>
<p>Samantala, nagbigay siya ng sentimyento tungkol sa hindi makatwirang Manila bay dolomite sand project ng Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) at Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) na gumastos ng milyong halaga aniya, “Kasi nga ang daming naghihirap ngayon, sobrang incompetent nila [gobyerno] mas iniisip pa nila (ang) ibang bagay kaysa riyan… dapat yung perang pang dolomite ginawang ayuda. “</p>
<p>Iginiit ni Valderamos, higit na makatutulong ang P10,000 ayuda pandagdag sa kanilang badyet ngunit maisakatuparan lamang daw ang hinahangad na ayuda sa bawat pamilya kung pokus lamang ang gobyerno sa higit na kailangan ng masa.</p>
<p>Ito rin ang naging sentimyento ng  solo parent na si Maria*, sapagkat ilang buwan itong nawalan ng trabaho buhat ng pansamantalang tigil-operasyon sa pinagtatrabahuang fast food restaurant noong kasagsagan ng ECQ noong nakaraang taon.</p>
<p>“Hindi sumasapat ang naitabi ko para sa gastusin ng anak ko. Umasa rin ako sa ayuda ng gobyerno, nakatulong pero hindi sapat [ang halaga ng ibinigay na ayuda],” saad nito.</p>
<p>Para kay Maria*, malaking tulong kung maisasakatuparan ang pamamahagi ng P10,000 ayuda upang maitawid ang gutom sa loob ng ilang araw at makapag-abot ng panggastos sa kanilang tahanan. Sa kabila nito, sinabi niya na kulang ang pagbibigay ng ayuda kung hindi masosolusyunan ang malawakang pagkawala ng trabaho.</p>
<p>“Mensahe ko sa gobyerno na ilaan nang maayos ang pondo lalo na sa mga nawalan ng trabaho na siyang tanging bumubuhay sa kanyang pamilya. Nawa’y naabutan lahat ng sapat na ayuda dahil tax namin iyon at pagdating ng panahon lahat ng Pilipino ang siyang magbabayad ng utang ng gobyerno,” ang panawagan ni Maria* sa mga kinauukulan.</p>
<p>Nito lamang Abril, inilunsad ng grupo ng masang Pilipino ang adbokasiyang 10k Ayuda Na Network.</p>
<p>“Ang 10K Ayuda Na Network ay isang malawak na samahan ng maralitang Pilipino para kagyat na mailabas at makamit ang maayos na distribusyon ng P10,000 ayuda. Layon ng network na tuloy-tuloy na mangalampag, makipag-diyalogo, at itulak ang pamahalaan na tuparin ang kanyang responsibilidad sa naghihikahos na mamamayan,” saad ng organisasyon sa kanilang Facebook Page.</p>
<h3 id="sampung-libong-ayuda-saan-naman-kukunin">Sampung libong ayuda, saan naman kukunin?</h3>
<p>Batay sa National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) noong 2018, sapat ang P10,000 para sa average na pamilyang binubuo ng limang miyembro.</p>
<p>Bilang suporta rito, ayon sa pagsusuri ng non-government research center na IBON Foundation nitong Pebrero, mayroon pang nalalabing P178.5 bilyong halaga  mula sa Bayanihan 1 at 2, taliwas sa sinasabi ni Duterte na wala nang pera ang bansa. Ayon sa NGO, ang kinakailangan lamang ay bigyan prayoridad ng gobyerno ang pamamahagi ng ayuda.</p>
<p>Dagdag pa, ayon sa kasalukuyang datos ng Bureau of the Treasury, umabot na sa Php 10.7 trilyon ang halaga ng inutang ng Pilipinas upang mabigyang tugon ang pagkalat ng COVID-19 at tulungan ang mga Pilipinong labis na naapektuhan dahil sa mga nagsarang kumpanya at mga establisyemento.</p>
<p>Taliwas dito, sa pananaliksik na isinagawa ng  IBON Foundation nitong Pebrero, ang pagpapatupad ng ECQ at MECQ sa mga lugar sa ilalim ng NCR+ ay nakapagdagdag lamang ng 12.1 milyon sa unemployed at underemployed na Pilipino sa bansa.</p>
<p>Itinuturong dahilan ng higit na pagtaas ng unemployment at underemployment rate ay ang kapabayaan ng gobyerno sa pagbibigay ng agarang solusyon at aksyon laban sa COVID-19.</p>
<p>Sa kabila ng pangungutang upang tulungan umano para sa mga Pilipinong labis na naapektuhan ng pandemya, inilahad sa breakdown ng inaprubahang badyet ngayong taon  ang napakalaking agwat ng alokasyon sa DOH na mayroon lamang Php 210.2 bilyon kumpara sa DPWH na mayroong Php 695.7 bilyon at Php 249.4 bilyon sa DILG.</p>
<p>Para sa IBON Foundation, ang kakagyatan sa pagresponde sa pandemya, pagtulong sa mga maysakit at ang pag-agapay sa mga Pilipinong nawalan ng hanapbuhay ang dapat pagtuunan ng pansin ng gobyerno, hindi ang pagpapatupad ng mga batas na aakit lamang sa mga dayuhang mamumuhunan sa bansa.</p>
<p>Ilan sa mga batas na agarang inamyendahan ni Pangulong Duterte sa kalagitnaan ng pandemya ay ang Public Services Act o ang pabibigay pahintulot sa full participation ng mga dayuhan sa pampublikong transportasyon at komunikasyon sa bansa;   Foreign Investments Act, na naglalayong pababain ang required na bilang ng empleyadong Pilipino sa dayuhang korporasyon; at Retail Trade Liberalization Act, na isinusulong ang pagpapababa sa paid-up capital ng mga dayong negosyante.</p>
<p>Sa kabilang banda, batay sa datos ng Asian Development Bank (ADB), buhat ng mababang fiscal stimulus at mataas na kaso ng COVID-19 sa bansa, umabot  lamang sa 3.8% ang Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ng Pilipinas. Ito ang pinakamababa sa buong Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Kaugnay nito, isinaad ng  PUP Economics Research Society Vice President for Finance na si Jennifer Balgos ang adbentahe ng pamamahagi ng P10,000 ayuda.</p>
<p>“Patungkol naman sa mabuting dulot ng P10,000 na ayuda, maituturing itong isa sa economic stimulus ng gobyerno na maaaring ituring na parte ng ating kasalukuyang fiscal policy na kung saan ay higit na makapag-aambag sa paglago ng ating GDP,” pagpapaliwanag ni Balgos.</p>
<p>Kaya, inirerekomenda ng IBON Foundation ang pagkakaroon ng expansionary fiscal policy o ang pagggastos ng gobyerno sa mga proyekto upang muling pasiglahin ang ekonomiya ng bansa. Iminumungkahi ng organisasyon ang badyet na nagkakahalagang Php 1.5 trilyon para rito.</p>
<p>Inilatag ng IBON ang mga maaaring pagkunan ng ganoong halaga gaya na lamang ng pag-realign sa pambansang badyet, pagpapataas ng buwis sa mga dambuhalang negosyante, pag-iisyu ng emergency bonds, pagbebenta ng government securities, at pagpapatupad ng land value tax.</p>
<p>Nakapaloob dito ang Php 540 bilyon na ayuda para sa 18 milyon na poor-low income families (tig-P10,000 kada pamilya sa loob ng tatlong buwan); Php 101 bilyon na wage subsidies sa micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) upang suportahan ang dagdag P100 kada araw na kita sa loob ng tatlong buwan; Php 40.5 bilyon para sa cash-for-work programs; Php 220 bilyon para sa suportahan ang sektor ng agrikultura; Php 200 bilyon para akayin ang mga MSMEs na itinaguyod ng mga Pilipino; Php 78 bilyon para sa informal earners; Php 200 bilyon para sa COVID-19 health response; at Php 113 bilyon upang pondohan ang distance learning.</p>

(Kuha ni Lucky dela Rosa)</p>

<p><span class="drop">A</span>ng taon ay 1896. Hudyat ng pagpunit ng sedula ang simula ng himagsikan laban sa 300-taong pananakop ng Espanya. Pinangunahan ito ni Andres Bonifacio, 28 taong gulang, kasama ang maraming kabataang miyembro ng Katipunan.</p>
<p>Ang taon ay 1970. Sinalubong ang mga unang buwan ng taon ng sunod-sunod at malakihang mga protesta laban sa rehimeng US-Marcos. Pinangunahan ng kabataan ang pagkilos sa mga lungsod at Pamantasan.</p>
<p>Hinubog ng pag-organisa’t pagkilos ng kabataan ang ating kasaysayan. Kaya’t nang palihim na inihimlay ang diktador sa Libingan ng mga Bayani, ipinakita ng kabataan ang kanilang mariing pagtutol. Tulad ng dating lumaban sa diktadura, sama-sama silang lumilikha ng kasaysayan sa lansangan.</p>
<h3 id="kung-hindi-tayo-kikilos-sino-ang-kikilos-kung-hindi-ngayon-kalian-pa">&lsquo;Kung hindi tayo kikilos, sino ang kikilos? Kung hindi ngayon, kalian pa?&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Umani ng batikos ang isinigawang protesta ng mga mag-aaral ng St. Scholastica’s College (SSC) laban sa libing ng yumaong diktador. Sa kabila ito ng mga dati nang pagprotesta ng mga “Kulasa” para sa mga Lumad o mga dinukot na batang Nigerian.</p>
<p>Dahil sa kanilang edad at kawalan ng karanasan, madalas na kinukuwestiyon ang kapasidad ng kabataan na unawain ang lipunan at maging bahagi ng diskusyong pulitikal at mga pagkilos. Ngunit taliwas ito sa ating kasaysayan. Sa katunayan, liberal na edukasyon at mga bagong ideya ang nagbigay-daan upang pangunahan ng kabataang Propagandista at Katipunero ang pag-alsa laban sa Espanya.</p>
<p>Sa pag-usbong ng mga bago at radikal na ideya sa mga pamantasan noong dekada ’60, kasabay ng iba pang pagkilos ng kabataan sa iba’t ibang panig ng mundo, muling umigting ang kamalayang makabayan ng kabataang Pilipino. Nagbigay sila ng matalas na pagsipat sa tumitinding kalagayan ng lipunan.</p>
<p>Pinatutunayan lamang nito na kritikal na edukasyon at kamalayan ang laging tumutulak sa kabataan upang harapin at kuwestiyunin ang realidad, at upang makapagsulong sila ng mga progresibong pagbabago kasama ng iba pang mga sektor ng lipunan.</p>
<p>Hindi nakapagtatakang kabataan din ang nanguna sa makasaysayang First Quarter Storm noong 1970 na yumanig sa rehimeng Marcos. Kalauna’y kabataan din, si Liliosa Hilao, ang unang naging biktima ng batas militar, at sinundan ng marami pang kabataang dinukot, tinortyur at pinatay.</p>
<p>Nagpatuloy ang pagtindig at pag-organisa ng maraming kabataan kasama ang uring manggagawa—mula sa pagpapatalsik sa diktador, paglaban kasama ng mga magsasaka, pagpigil sa tuition hike, pagpapatalsik muli sa isang pangulo, planong pagbitay sa isang OFW, at sa maraming isyung mahalaga sa lipunan.</p>
<h3 id="kapag-namulat-ka-sa-katotohanan-kasalanan-na-ang-pumikit">&lsquo;Kapag namulat ka sa katotohanan, kasalanan na ang pumikit.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Karaniwang ipinagpapalagay ng marami na sagabal sa “edukasyon” ng kabataan ang kanilang pakikilahok sa mga kilos-protesta. Ikinukulong pa rin ang edukasyon sa apat na sulok ng klasrum, pamantayan ng kaalaman ang grado, at ang diploma’y tiket para makapagtrabaho.</p>
<p>Nagiging bangkong walang laman ang isang mag-aaral, ayon sa guro at pilosopong si Paulo Freire sa “Pedagogy of the Oprressed.” Sa “banking model” ng edukasyon, lagi lamang nakabukas ang “bangko” upang pasibong tanggapin ang anumang kaalamang idedeposito ng guro. Kaya ang mga paaralan ay nananatiling espasyo ng kompetisyon at hindi para sa makabuluhang diskurso, at pinananatili lamang ng edukasyon ang karahasan sa lipunan.</p>
<p>Malayo ito sa radikal at mas makabuluhang tunguhin para sa mga “pag-asa ng bayan” na natunghayan sa kasaysayan. Para kay Freire, mahalaga sa tunay na paglaya ng lipunan ang isang edukasyong huhubog sa kritikal na kamalayan. Hindi na lamang dapat pasibong tagapagmasid at bangko ng impormasyon ang kabataan; kailangang kaya na nilang kilalanin at suriin ang mga isyu ng lipunan.</p>
<p>Pinatunayan ito ng libu-libong mag-aaral na sumama at nanguna sa mga nakaraang kilos-protesta. Bagaman pilit na nililimitahan ang pakikilahok nila sa mga isyu, ipinapakita nila na nananatili ang pagiging mapanuri at kritikal ng kabataan. Hindi pa man ipinapanganak ang mga millennial noong Batas Militar, kaya nilang pumanig sa tamang bersyon ng kasaysayan.</p>
<h3 id="temperamental-brats-will-change-the-world">&lsquo;Temperamental brats will change the world!&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Tumataliwas ang ipinakitang pagmobilisa ng kabataan sa katangiang pilit ikinakabit sa “millennials”—indibidwalista at kimi sa mga isyu. Hindi naman sang-ayon si Propesor Sarah Raymundo ng UP Sociology na tawagin pa ring “millennials” ang kabataan.</p>
<p>“There is no good reason for us to believe that the generation lens, which was originally invented for the study of markets of bourgeois consumption, is a good way to approach political mobilizations organized around revolution,” aniya. Dagdag ni Raymundo, mas tapat na tawaging “petit-bourgeoisie” ang “millennials.”</p>
<p>Bagaman kinikilalang petit-bourgeois ang maraming kabataan, hindi ito nangangahulugang wala silang kakayahang sumama sa pakikibaka ng mamamayan. Mababalikan ang naging pagkakamali ng dating Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP) noong 1930s—ang hindi nito pagtiwala at pagtanggap sa sektor ng mag-aaral dahil sa kanilang burgis na katangian, isang dahilan upang humina ang kilusang kabataan sa harap ng kolonyalismong Amerikano.</p>
<p>Ayon kay Amado P. Guerrero sa Philippine Society and Revolution, mahalaga ang posisyon ng petit-bourgeois—mga may iilang pagmamay-ari tulad ng kabataang estudyante, intelektwal, at propesyunal—dahil sa kanilang kakayahang mag-impluwensya at humubog ng pampublikong diskurso.</p>
<p>Kapansin-pansin sa mga protesta ang malikhaing mga placard: “Magnanakaw AF,” “Hero? ‘Wag ako gurl,” at “Bumagsak man grades ko, ‘wag lang ang bayan ko!” Nagagamit ng kabataang nagtungo sa lansangan ang kanilang lenggwahe, sabihin mang petit-bourgeois, upang itawid ang kanilang mensahe sa mga kapwa-kabataan at isulong ang interes ng mamamayan.</p>

<p>Ikinabigla at ikinatuwa naman ng mga biktima ng Batas Militar ang dami ng kabataan na nagprotesta. “Nararamdaman sa kaibuturan ng ating puso ang pagpapanibagong siklab ng pambansang demoktratikong pakikibaka ng kabataan at estudyante,” ani Satur Ocampo, biktima ng Batas Militar at isa sa mga nagtatag ng Kabataang Makabayan.</p>
<p>Ang taon ay 2016. Sa makasaysayang pagsasama-sama ng mamamayan noong Nobyembre 25, ipinasa ng mga dating aktibista at biktima ng Batas Militar ang sulo sa bagong mga lider-kabataan. Para sa bagong salinlahi, nagpapatuloy ang nasimulan.</p>

<p><span class="drop">A</span>nti-Terror Law oral arguments continue as Days 7 and 8 were held simultaneously on May 11 and 12 via Zoom, with Solicitor General Jose Calida still avoiding interpellations and letting his assistants trip over questions regarding ATL’s vague standards.</p>
<p>The on-going debate began on February 2 after several delays from Calida. This focuses on the purpose of the Anti-Terror law, its unconstitutionality and its possible dangers for the masses.</p>
<p>There are a total of 37 petitions filed against the said law that were authored by framers of the 1987 Constitution, human rights advocates, lawyers groups, members of the academe, religious organizations, and individuals who have been a victim of red-tagging.</p>
<h3 id="osg-insists-that-there-are-no-vague-provisions-in-atl">OSG insists that there are no vague provisions in ATL</h3>
<p>On May 11, the seventh day of ATL’s oral arguments, the Supreme Court justices raised concerns on the vague provisions of the draconian law, and the possible dangers of the law on red-tagged groups and individuals.</p>
<p>Associate Justice Rodil Zalameda asked why the authors of the ATL did not use a “modifier” on the phrase “provoke the government” when the law defined what will acts of terrorism account for.</p>
<p>However, Assistant Solicitor General (ASG) Raymund Rigodon disagreed that the definition of acts of terrorism is vague.</p>
<p>The definition of terrorism under the Human Security Act used to specify “predicate crimes” such as piracy, rebellion or insurrection, coup d’etat, murder, kidnapping, arson, hijacking, highway robbery, illegal possession and manufacture of firearms and explosives, and violations of the laws regulating toxic substances and nuclear wastes and atomic energy.</p>
<p>This was replaced by some criteria that petitioners deemed unclear, such as acts intended to cause death or injury, damage to property, or using weapons or dangerous substances to “intimidate the general public or a segment thereof, create an atmosphere or spread a message of fear, to provoke or influence by intimidation the government or any international organization, or seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic, or social structures of the country, or create a public emergency or seriously undermine public safety.”</p>
<p>With other provisions that punish speech and actions that may be interpreted as supportive of terrorism, the petitioners themselves, human rights advocates and progressive groups pointed out the law might include the traditionally protected form of expression against government’s shortcomings.</p>
<p>“It is not merely provocation. What I fear about is the phrase ‘provoke the government’ is too vague so as to include any kind of provocation. It did not say that to provoke a government to do or to abstain from doing an act. Just it stated that to provoke the government,” said Zalameda.</p>
<p>When asked by Associate Justice Benjamin Caguioa about who will determine the standard of “creating an atmosphere of fear” Rigodon answered the arresting agents. This was after Rigodon failed to answer the former’s question about his understanding of “atmosphere of fear”.</p>
<p>The state forces have the judicial power, for instance in a physical protest, to declare whether the event is indeed “creating an atmosphere of fear”, requiring activists to prove that they do not intend to cause harm.</p>
<p>“Remember that you are depriving that person a fundamental liberty, a fundamental right to be free, and are you saying that can be done even if there is no standard, or even if that standard is susceptible to different interpretations, as many policemen as there are?” Caguioa said.</p>
<h3 id="done-process-over-due-process">Done process over due process</h3>
<p>Red tagging an individual, group, organization, or institution mirrors the idea of putting a guilty verdict on them even without substantial proof, which is contrary to the principle of presumption of innocence under 1987 Constitution, Bill of Rights Section 14.</p>
<p>It can be remembered that in July 2020, Duterte, during one of his televised pre-recorded speeches, assured the Filipinos they should not be afraid of the ATL if they are not guilty of being a terrorist.</p>
<p>“For the law-abiding citizen of this country, I am addressing you with all sincerity, do not be afraid if you are not a terrorist.”</p>
<p>On the 7th day of ATL oral argument, Rigodon reiterated this. However, this promise has already been used before during the drug war but the campaign still took more than 20,000 lives, targeting mostly poor communities, putting suspects on ‘drug lists’ compiled by local community leaders.</p>
<p>While Sen. Bato Dela Rosa claims that policemen did not want to harm innocent civilians but “shit happens” in an “imperfect world”, the Duterte regime has created a culture of impunity.</p>
<p>The innocent lives taken were downgraded into collateral damage, justice is hardly served when the Philippine National Police (PNP) themselves are uncooperative in investigations.</p>
<p>Even after the promises during the height of his state-sponsored killings, innocent lives were still taken without accountability from the state forces who executed almost instantaneously. Duterte’s empty rhetoric about ‘not being afraid of ATL’ does not guarantee the safety of the public, especially if the draconian law follows ‘done process’ than ‘due process’.</p>
<p>“Is that enough? Is that enough to allay the fears, the suspicions, the apprehensions, the repugnance of the public? Is lip service enough?” Associate Justice Amy Lazaro-Javier asked Rigodon during the oral argument in relation to their assertion that there is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Rigodon answered her through reading the law’s regulation policy but he was cut off as Javier rested the case and said, “Please pardon me, but I think the answer is not responsive to my question. So please, I have no time to debate with you on this, so please present this in your memorandum.”</p>
<h3 id="on-the-relentless-red-tagging-of-ntf-elcac-frontmen">On the relentless red-tagging of NTF-ELCAC frontmen</h3>
<p>Still on the seventh day of the oral arguments, government lawyers were pressed regarding the relentless red-tagging of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC).</p>
<p>Associate Justice Javier cited red-tagged partylist groups Gabriela Women’s Party and Kabataan, even when they have never been mentioned in any official resolutions and proclamations as fronts of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People’s Army (CPP-NPA).</p>
<p>“Does this mean that after all these months of tagging Kabataan and Gabriela as fronts of the CPP and NPA, there is insufficient evidence linking them to said terrorist organizations after all?” she asked.</p>
<p>ASG Marissa dela Cruz-Galandines did not answer and instead deferred to National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr., who was supposed to present himself on the next day of the oral arguments.</p>
<p>Since the law was passed, activists and journalists have reportedly been labeled “communists,” and “terrorists,” have been threatened, jailed on trumped up charges with planted evidence, tortured, and killed during the execution of “search warrants”.</p>
<p>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) has argued that NTF-ELCAC spokesperson Lieutenant General Antonio Parlade Jr’s red-tagging on his social media accounts is done in his personal accounts.</p>
<p>Javier asked if ever the government had disavowed his statements. They did not. The Department of Justice (DOJ) secretary Menardo Guevarra, who is also among the 20 members of the NTF-ELCAC, even deferred to his undersecretary when he was asked whether he stands by the public claims of Parlade and Press Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy regarding the ‘communist links’ of the community pantries.</p>
<p>It can be remembered that during Day 6, Galandines told the Supreme Court that red-tagging was a term coined by leftists, and that what the government did was “truth-tagging.”</p>
<p>According to Rappler’s fact-checking report, the terms “red-tagging,” “red tag” or “red-tagged” were already used in writings that involve communism even before Jose Maria Sison founded the CPP in 1968.</p>
<p>Galandines claimed that “truth-tagging” involves a “comprehensive, detailed and careful evaluation of circumstances before the government comes up with the tagging of a person or organization.”</p>
<p>NTF-ELCAC did not present any evidence to support their claims that the progressive groups, human rights defenders, activists and union leaders they tagged were indeed part of CPP-NPA.</p>
<h3 id="the-anti-terrorism-councils-unconstitutionality">The Anti-Terrorism Council’s unconstitutionality</h3>
<p>In ATL’s provision, ATC, currently headed by Executive Secretary, have the authority to designate individuals and organizations as terrorists without any hearing, as long as it deems that there is a ‘probable cause’ that they commit any acts defined as terrorism under the Sections 4 to 12. ATC would not have to obtain warrants from the courts to do this.</p>
<p>Petitioners stressed that the authority vested in ATC violates the Supreme Court’s rule-making power.</p>
<p>A day after the Day 8 of the oral arguments, the Anti-Terrorism Council released a resolution formally tagging 19 people as terrorists, which include CPP founder Jose Maria Sison and his wife Julieta Sison, National Democratic Front of the Philippines peace consultants Benito Tiamzon, Wilma Tiamzon, Rafael Baylosis, Vicente Ladlad and other alleged members of the CPP.</p>
<p>The resolution claims that the 19 listed violated Sections 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.</p>
<p>“Based on verified and validated information, the ATC found probable cause, as defined in the Anti-Terrorism Act, warranting the designation of the following central committee members of the CPP… for planning, preparing, facilitating, conspiring, and inciting the commission of terrorism and recruitment to and membership in a terrorist organization or a group organized for the purpose of engaging in terrorism,” the resolution read.</p>
<p>On Section 27, courts are permitted to declare preliminary groups as terrorists even without a full hearing. If it finds probable cause and finds the petition sufficient in form and substance, it can issue within 72 hours a preliminary order of proscription, meaning people can be declared as terrorists right away.</p>
<p>The passage allows the council to label a person a terrorist, without requiring said person the opportunity to present contrary evidence. This is contrary to the Bill of Rights Article III, Sec. 14, which states that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt; and Section 18, which states that no person shall be detained solely by reason of his political beliefs and aspirations and no involuntary servitude in any form shall exist except as a punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-misconception-with-communisms-legality">On the misconception with communism’s legality</h3>
<p>Associate Justice Marvic Leonen, on the other hand, pointed out that terrorism goes beyond communist terrorism and communism is not a crime in itself.</p>
<p>Leonen said to be a communist is not wrong because to be a communist simply “means you believe in the writings of Karl Marx and the communist manifesto.”</p>
<p>In 1992, then-President Fidel V. Ramos already repealed the Anti- Subversion Law, a law that made being a member of the CPP illegal.</p>
<p>“Are we going after those that we deem leftist simply because we feel them as leftist? And contrary to the opinion of others, being leftist is again pejorative, because it reflects on whoever is labeling that person. What if I told you I’m socialist? Am I leftist? What if I told you that in the heart of my hearts, I believe that the ownership of means of production should be in the hands of workers, am I communist?” Leonen asked.</p>
<p>Yet again, the government lawyers could only put a loose end answer with Galandines saying that ideologies should never be punished.</p>
<h3 id="senator-drilon-files-bill-to-criminalize-red-tagging">Senator Drilon files bill to criminalize red-tagging</h3>
<p>On March 24, Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon filed Senate Bill No. 2121, an Act Defining and Penalizing the Crime of Red-tagging. The Bill seeks to punish red-tagging state agents with up to ten years in prison and disqualification from public office.</p>
<p>In the said bill, red-tagging was defined as the “act of labeling, vilifying, branding, naming, accusing, harassing, persecuting, stereotyping, or caricaturing individuals, groups, or organizations as state enemies, left-leaning, subversives, communists, or terrorists as part of a counter-insurgency or anti-terrorism strategy or program, by any state actor, such as law enforcement agent, paramilitary, or military personnel.”</p>
<p>“The passage of this bill will reverse the ‘increasingly institutionalization and normalization of human rights violations’ and put a stop on the attacks against the members of the legal profession,” Drilon said in the bill’s explanatory note.</p>
<p>Anyone found guilty will face up to 10 years jail time and disqualification of persons convicted from holding public office.</p>
<p>It can be remembered that in February, the senate panel insisted that there is no need to criminalize red-tagging in the Philippines since there are already legal remedies available to an aggrieved party. But after the Senate employees’ unions were accused of having communist links, Senate President Vicente Sotto III expressed his support for the bill against red-tagging.</p>
<p>“Victims are left without proper recourse against their perpetrators and are forced to file seemingly-appropriate-but-not-quite-cases, like libel and grave threats,” Drilon said.</p>
<p>For petitioners and supporters of junking ATL, libel cases, writ of habeas data and writ of amparo are not enough for the protection of the victims because they do not get the right and adequate justice. Red-tagging has already killed several people and therefore protection and justice for the victims must be served.</p>
<p>Activism and communism are not crimes, as the Anti-Subversion Law was repealed in 1992. In the culture of impunity Duterte has created, attacks and trumped up charges against human rights defenders, journalists, activists and the masses continue to prevail. The red-tagging spree of state forces mouthpieces against the critics of the government is a clear violation of the Section 4 of the Bill of Rights. Anti-Terror Law only grants the regime excessive and unchecked powers that further jeopardise democracy.</p>

<p><span class="drop">M</span>any things have been said about this university. Many things have been written about what&rsquo;s wrong with it, like the alleged Americanization and the DOW contracts and the very large deficit. But of all that has been said and written, none has made mention of a situation that casts a shadow of doubt on the measure of our institutions as a university and could seriously challenge its claims to excellence.</p>
<p>One of the very obvious—and therefore cry much taken for granted—functions of the university is to serve as a place where minds meet, a place where there is a free intercourse of ideas, where one can integrate the bits of information he has gathered into meaningful and functional knowledge. The inadequacy of our university becomes evident in this aspect. There is no such meeting of minds, no traffic of ideas between the scientists and the non-scientists in this university. There is no evidence at all of any attempt at integration: The scientist and the non-scientist simply cannot understand each other. They do not communicate.</p>
<p>Worse, none has expressed an awareness of this problem. Until very recently.</p>
<h3 id="neglect">Neglect</h3>
<p>Three issues ago, an English major wrote that science has been neglected in the university. Neglect, meaning dilapidated laboratories equipped with obsolescent apparatus because very little of the P15-lab-fee-per-student really is spent on the laboratories. Neglect, also meaning apathy on the part of the non-scientists—those who are in the arts, social sciences, and humanities, with regard to the needs of the scientists, those in the natural sciences. Take, for example. R.A. 3887, better known as the Natural Science Research Center law, establishing such a center &ldquo;pursuant to the national policy of promoting scientific research and invention in the Philippines.”</p>
<p>While in the last campus elections most of the political parties promised to work for its immediate implementation, it would still be too presumptuous for one to consider such pledges as a genuine sign of awareness and concern. For there is more reason to believe that these were merely shrewd political gimmicks aimed at carrying the science votes. The indifference of the non-scientists was best displayed when a rally was staged to demand more concrete action on the establishment of the research center. Only a handful of students—all from the sciences—joined the rally. The non-science students, having ignored the invitation to join the scientists in this cause, were busy &ldquo;minding their own business,” as if science were not their business.</p>
<p>Yet neglect does not seem to be a very accurate word, for it would appear to lay blame only on the non-scientists and say nothing of the scientists. Which is quite unfair, because the scientists are just as guilty as the non-scientists and both are to blame. Or maybe neither.</p>
<h3 id="responsible-scientists">Responsible Scientists</h3>
<p>We are surprised, for example, how the controversies on the DOW Chemicals and USAF contracts could have passed without a single word of comment from the scientists. Or how such silence could have passed unnoticed by the non-scientists. We can understand—but not necessarily justify—why the scientists would reserve the right to comment on the alleged consent to and participation in a cruel and inhuman and irrational war and American imperialism, which to them may appear trivial and inconsequential. But that was not all there was to the protest. There was also the issue of the manner in which man, through technology, makes use of scientific discoveries and how responsible a scientist is when lives and property are destroyed by the products of his research. On these issues, the scientists cannot afford to be silent. For their silence can only be taken as irrefutable proof of their lack of awareness, and their lack of awareness to mean a lack of responsibility, if not ignorance.</p>
<p>It is perhaps understandable why there is such a mutual I-don&rsquo;t-care attitude. The experiences non-scientists have in the sciences are not exactly very pleasant. These include, among others, noxious fumes from the chem labs, the fishy, nauseating odor from the zoology pavilion, some sleepy lecture hours in a physics class, plus a number of irritating habits of eccentric would-be scientists. The scientists, on the other hand, are reminded of equally traumatic experiences in their non-science classes: uninteresting readings in western thought, uninspiring short stories and meaningless poetry, and the intolerable inaccuracy and unbearable subjectivity of the non-science students and other teachers.</p>
<h3 id="ivory-towers">Ivory towers</h3>
<p>Or it is highly probable that the scientist-in-ivory-tower mentality still prevails in the university. Long ago, the scientist enjoyed the reputation of one who was quite different from and in fact superior to the rest of humanity. It was believed that his sole responsibility to society was to perform experiments and do scientific research. He was therefore allowed to retreat to some cold, isolated ivory tower where he could best perform his function, undisturbed and uncontaminated by the rest of human activity. For a long time, this arrangement worked. Man took full advantage of the discoveries of the scientist-in-the-ivory-tower and enjoyed all the conveniences made possible by advances in scientific research. And all was well.</p>
<p>The prevalence of this attitude can probably explain the present situation in this university, where there is this mutual mind-your-own-business attitude—where the non-scientists would leave the scientists alone in their ill-lit, poorly ventilated cloisters, where the latter dissect cats and dogfish, or verify physical laws, or contemplate some complex structural formula, refusing to have anything to do with dirty politics, dull literature, and fresh air.</p>
<p>But this concept cannot be justified, nor can it be tolerated. It cannot be tolerated because it is very old and obsolete. And wrong.</p>
<p>In 1945, the atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing thousands of human beings, leaving miles and miles of scorched wasteland, posing a threat of annihilation to mankind. And destroying that ivory tower. After the second world war, the scientists could no longer hide behind their cloak of objectivity and unconcern. For the first time the scientists felt guilt. And as Oppenheimer himself described their feeling of troubled concern, “they have known sin.”</p>
<h3 id="cooperation">Cooperation</h3>
<p>From this guilt came a sense of responsibility. The scientists realized that their responsibility to mankind was not only to make scientific discoveries, but also to prepare man for it, so that he may not use it to destroy himself. It is their responsibility to teach science because science could be taught—to correct the misconceptions of the non-scientists by teaching science as a method, and not as a doctrine, by showing that despite its being a powerful tool, science has its limitations.</p>
<p>The non-scientists, too, have their responsibilities. They should know science and learn it because it could be learned. And because handling a potentially destructive weapon of which one is ignorant ends in self destruction. It is their responsibility, further, to humanize the sciences because the sciences have become dehumanized—and inhumane.</p>
<p>There was therefore a need for communication for a meeting of minds, for a free traffic of ideas between the two, so that they may perform their tasks, and save mankind. This was the lesson man learned a quarter of a century ago, and which we still have to learn now, in this university.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="drop">M</span>alakas tumawa, masayahin—animo’y walang iniindang kalungkutan. Pero kung ako’y nag-iisa at sa tuwing nananalamin, marami akong katanungan sa sarili. Tumanda akong hindi buo, marami ang kulang sa akin. ‘Yan ang malungkot na parte ng buhay ko na hindi ko maitatanggi. Hindi ko man lang nakilala o nakita ang aking tatay at lumaki ako sa pangangalaga ng tiyahin ko. Namasukan ako, kapalit ng pag-aaral ko.</p>
<p>Uhaw na uhaw ako sa pagmamahal ng isang ama, uhaw sa pagmamahal ng isang buong pamilya. Kaya sa tuwing makakakita ako noon ng isang buo ang pamilya, inggit na inggit ako at naiiyak. Pero tamang punas lang ng luha at sasabihin sa sarili, “Sila ‘yun, iba ka.” Gano’n lagi. Hindi ko rin naranasan noong bata ako ang maglaro sa labas, ang maging malaya.</p>
<p>Bata pa lang ako, kailangan ko na magtrabaho para makapag-aral at kailangan ko paghirapan ang binibigay sa aking baon na limang piso araw-araw. Pagkaminsan, may isang piraso ng nilagang saba—ayun lang, sapat na.</p>
<p>Nairaos ko ang elementarya na gano’n ang sistema ng buhay ko. Paulit-ulit umiikot ang buhay ko sa eskwela at bahay ng tita ko. Hindi nila alam kung paano ko nairaos ang mga kailangan ko sa eskwela at mga project. Dumiskarte ako dahil may mga tamad akong kaklase noon at ako ang gumagawa ng mga assignment nila, at may bayad silang masarap na pagkain kinabukasan. Baon-baon ko ang diskarteng ‘yun hanggang high school.</p>
<p>Hindi naman kaila sa mga guro at kaeskwela ko ang katayuan ko sa buhay noon, bagkus hinahangaan pa nga nila ako. Ayun nga lang, nalulungkot ang mga guro ko kapag kailangan akong sabitan ng medalya at walang magulang na pumupunta para sa akin. Naiiyak man ako, pero kailangan kong maging matatag dahil ako lang ang makakatulong sa sarili ko. Natuto akong lumaban sa buhay nang mag-isa.</p>
<p>Matapos ang yugto ng buhay ko sa high school, hindi na ako nakapagkolehiyo. Tinamad ako, napagod at nawala sa diskarte. Nabarkada sa hindi maganda, nakapag-asawa nang maaga. Hindi ko magawang sisihin ang sarili sa mga maling desisyon ko. Sadyang wala lang akong masandalan noong mga panahong kailangan ko ng masasandalan. Ipinangako ko sa sarili ko na kapag bumuo ako ng pamilya, hindi ako magkukulang—bubusugin ko ang mga anak ko sa pagmamahal. Sisikapin kong hindi nila maranasan ang mga dinanas ko.</p>
<p>Kahit sobrang naiiyak sila kapag kinukwento ko ang  mga pinagdaanan ko, lagi kong sinasabi na iyon ang halimbawa ng hindi pagtatanim ng sama ng loob dahil ngayon, nakikita nila kung paano ko mahalin at alagaan ang nanay ko kapag nasa akin siya. Kaya sobrang mahal nila lola nila. Nanay ko siya at nag-iisa lang siya. Ayoko nang isumbat pa sa kanya ang mga pinagdaanan ko. Ang mahalaga ay ‘yung ngayon na dapat ay maging masaya.</p>
<p>Ngayong isa na akong nanay, buo na ako. Binuo ako ng mga anak ko. Ginagawa ko ang lahat para maging isang mabuting ina sa kanila. Hindi man kami mayaman sa materyal na bagay, punung-puno naman kami ng yaman sa paggalang at pagmamahalan. Nakakaranas man ako ng hindi magagandang alaala, napapalitan naman ang mga ito ng mga masaya’t makulay at puno ng pag-asa.</p>
<p>Lumaki man akong hindi buo, at least ngayon, maipagmamalaki ko ang binuo kong pamilya. Dumanas man ako noon ng pait sa buhay, ngayon walang kasing tamis ang aking saya mula sa aking asawa at mga anak.</p>

	                <p><span class="drop">&ldquo;O</span>nly those with independent means can afford independent views.” Virginia Woolf, the English writer, stated this truism. I can honestly claim that for much of my writing life, my views were my own, unshackled and free. I’ve tried my very best to sustain that freedom till now. Sure, I have biases&ndash;all of us do&ndash;but these are not shaped in an imprisoned mind.</p>
<p>I have no properties that own me&ndash;just this house in Project 8 and this little bookshop in Padre Faura. My National Artist stipend of P50,000 a month, The Philippine STAR fee for my Monday column the occasional honoraria for my lectures and the 30 percent of all sales in my bookshop allow me a decent living. Thank God we have seven children who will not allow my wife and me to go hungry if we go bankrupt.</p>
<p>I never had social or political ambition. All I really wanted to do was to write, to compete with the world’s best whose works I had admired. Ambition? Yes, I wanted to be this country’s best novelist. In this goal, no one can really help me. It is an effort, solitary and self-consuming but come to think of it, so spiritually satisfying; in the end, I realized, it was my own self I was competing with. Vanquish the ego when I edit myself, when I yield to compassion, to others.</p>
<h2 id="public-charity">Public charity</h2>
<p>But I must be charitable with myself first before I offer help to others. This thought comes to mind as charitable-initiatives like the Community Pantry are very much in the news this week. Charity to one’s self is not pampering one’s self. It means being kind to one’s self, to admit our faults and forgive ourselves, to admit human frailty and likewise forgive those who did us wrong. Of course, I’ve always known the institutionalized do-gooding of the Catholic Church, but it is so rich, it could do much much more, set up soup kitchens for the hungry, shelter for the homeless. And all those billionaires. In this pandemic, why haven’t they donated vaccines by the millions?</p>
<h2 id="our-political-leaders">Our political leaders</h2>
<p>But while I was never interested in a political career, I was fascinated by our politicians and the political process, particularly how our political leaders failed. As a writer I got to know some of them not as politicians but as men of clay.</p>
<p>When I came to Manila in 1938 to attend high school, the flamboyant Manuel Quezon was already in Malacañan. We knew him as a playboy. He fled to the United States in 1942 to lead the government in exile. He died there. The presidents who succeeded Quezon – Osmeña, Roxas and Quirino – all belonged to the old school of political leaders who relied on their parties to propel them to power. Ramon Magsaysay is the first candidate for president to change this by going directly to the people. He was a game changer. After him, Garcia, then Macapagal. They were ordinary with occasional flashes of vision – Filipino first for Garcia, regionalism for Macapagal.</p>
<p>Then Marcos who ruled longest and had the most impact on society and politics, and after him Cory who was a disaster and her son, Noynoy. Cory was “mata pobre.” The Mendiola massacre of peasant demonstrators shortly after she assumed power illustrated her callousness, as did her son in his response to the Yolanda disaster and the Mamasapano slaughter. Fidel V. Ramos – he is the only president who should have modernized the Armed Forces – this was his greatest failing whose result bedevils us today as China slowly nibbles our sovereignty. And Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, I owe her my National Artist Award; next to Marcos, her regime was longest, lackluster and marred by the “Hello, Garci” scandal.</p>
<p>In assessing our politicians and their performance, I don’t rely just on what I see on TV, Facebook or commentaries in the newspapers. I have informants, some of them academics or technocrats. It’s so easy to validate information; all Filipinos are open and they love to talk. I never met Ramon Ang, the tycoon who Danding Cojuangco named his heir, but I have heard so many good things he is doing not just for his people. There is a call for him to run for president next year. If he does and he wins, I am sure he won’t be a local version of Donald Trump.</p>
<h2 id="dutertes-star">Duterte’s star</h2>
<p>Now, here is a forecast worth betting on. It may turn out that for all his vulgar language, Rodrigo Roa Duterte may yet be, next to Magsaysay, the best president we ever had. All the criticisms considered, just remember this – the country is far safer now than at any other time. And inspite of the poverty, the economy is sure to recover; our foreign reserves are the highest ever. So much infrastructure has been built to hasten development – and this, too, is coming as more and more landlords are becoming producers. The Moro rebellion, I hope, will now wind down as the Moros themselves realize development will assure them peace. As for the communists, their terrorist front, the New People’s Army, is now under attack. I hope it is demolished soon.</p>
<p>The Communist Party was decriminalized by President Ramos, but no politician wants to proclaim himself a communist. So, the party has many front organizations. All should be identified. Communist parties exist in Western Europe, in Japan but these parties don’t have front organizations engaged in armed revolt. Thousands have died and billions lost in this protracted war that is now more than 50 years. It is time the response of the State must be conclusive.</p>
<h2 id="opportunists">Opportunists</h2>
<p>What aggravates the communist rebellion are the opportunists in Congress, in media, the business sector and politicians who curry favor for the communists’ support and for self-protection; they will cease doing this when they are convinced it is no longer necessary or profitable to do so.</p>
<h2 id="search-for-meaning">Search for meaning</h2>
<p>Sometime in our lives, we ask these questions: who am I, where am I going? In this my twilight, I have mulled over these questions and more – why am I writing? Of what use is Art? Why Freedom? And above all, have I given this mundane life any meaning? As for that lofty literary goal, it is honor enough to be nominated to the Nobel, but at 96, I know I’ll not get it. My spirit always lifts though whenever I recall what Tim Kindseth of Time magazine said, that my Rosales novels are “rivaled only by Rizal’s Noli and Fili.”</p>

		<p class="card-text">Posse volunteers submitted a petition with 40,348 signatures to immigration officials at a meeting on April 14. (NHK)</p>
	</div>
	
</div>
<p>As Japanese lawmakers debate revisions to the country&rsquo;s immigration law, protesters - including asylum seekers, their supporters and lawyers - have been marching through Tokyo to oppose the proposals which they claim are cruel and inhumane. A United Nations panel shares their concerns about the forcible deportation of asylum seekers, lack of judicial review, and the imposition of criminal penalties on people who fail to comply with expulsion orders.</p>
<p>The revisions are designed to address the long-term detention of some foreigners. Deaths in custody have highlighted the plight of detainees, including the cases of a Sri Lankan woman who died at an immigration facility in Nagoya last month and a Nigerian man who took up a hunger strike to protest long-term detention in 2019 in Nagasaki Prefecture.</p>
<p>Most foreigners who are issued deportation orders by Japan&rsquo;s Immigration Services Agency comply and leave the country. But those who do not are taken into custody. This includes asylum seekers. The agency says it accepted about one percent of refugee applications in 2020.</p>
<h3 id="petition-gathers-40000-signatures">Petition gathers 40,000 signatures</h3>
<p>One of the groups leading the protest campaign is Posse, which is run largely by people in their teens and 20s. The non-profit, based in Tokyo and Miyagi Prefecture, provides consultation services for foreign workers, students, technical trainees and asylum seekers.</p>
<p>Posse launched an online petition in both Japanese and English urging lawmakers to scrap the draft revision. It gathered over 40,000 signatures in two months. On April 14, about 20 volunteers, mostly university students, presented the petition to immigration officials.</p>
<p>They also outlined their concerns about the current proposals.</p>
<p>University student Iwamoto Nana does volunteer work in support of young Kurdish asylum seekers in Saitama Prefecture out on provisional release. One of them is the same age as her and has become a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend has already applied for refugee status three times,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If the draft revision is passed, she could be forcibly deported, criminalized, and her life could be endangered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iwamoto notes that many others face similar situations. She says asylum seekers in Japan &ldquo;are part of our society, living together with us. We should never reach a situation where their lives are taken over; they are criminalized, and excluded from our society.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="japans-standpoints">Japan&rsquo;s standpoints</h3>
<p>The draft revision would allow for the forcible deportation of asylum seekers who have applied for refugee status three or more times. Criminal penalties would be imposed if they failed to comply with deportation orders. This is designed to stop people making repeated applications in a bid to stall the process.</p>
<p>The changes, which aim to reduce the number of foreigners in detention, would permit some people on the deportation list to stay with family members or supporters until they leave the country.</p>
<p>A United Nations Human Rights Council on Arbitrary Detention panel issued a statement last month that maintains the Japanese proposal &ldquo;falls short of international human rights standards.&rdquo; The working group that considered the draft revision found that the basic policy of using detention in the deportation process is unchanged. Members are concerned that some migrants would remain in custody for limitless periods without judicial review.</p>
<p>The UN statement points out that the revision allowing for the forcible deportation of people who have had their refugee status application denied three or more times could be a violation of international law. According to Japan&rsquo;s Justice Minister Kamikawa Yoko, the criticisms are misplaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The draft revision was studied by a panel of experts, including international legal scholars, lawyers and NGO officials,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If the UN panel had a chance to hear explanations by the Japanese government in advance, it would have correctly understood the background, content and appropriateness of the revision.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="the-way-forward">The way forward</h3>
<p>Posse leader Iwahashi Makoto says his group is looking beyond the current battle: &ldquo;Many young people are showing interest in issues facing foreigners. They oppose the draft revision and feel angry about human rights violations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abolishing the draft revision is not enough. We will continue to oppose it, and join forces to seek a guarantee for foreigners - including asylum seekers - of the universal human right to live without fear of deportation or poverty. We will demand the government allows them to access social security as they don&rsquo;t have a safety net.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="drop">F</span>ireworks of a different kind exploded last April 27 when politicians commented on the 500th anniversary of the Victory in Mactan. Cavite Vice Gov. Jolo Revilla posted on FB: “A salute to the bravery of one of the first heroes of the nation, Ferdinand Magellan, who gave his life for freedom 500 years ago!” Called out by netizens, Revilla blamed an “intern” who supposedly posted on his FB page without clearance.</p>
<p>There was also clickbait from presidential spokesperson Harry Roque: “President Rodrigo Roa Duterte is my modern day Lapulapu, especially his independent foreign policy. It means that we are friends to all, we have no enemies, he doesn’t shy away before any foreigner.”</p>
<p>But the winner is Sen. Bong Go, who doused the once-in-500-years jubilation of Cebuanos by declaring that Lapulapu was a Tausug! Worse, Lapulapu, Raja of Mactan, was reduced to a warrior sent by the Sultan of Sulu to confirm reports of foreigners in Cebu. Go cited a certain Abraham Idjirani as his source. Idjirani is an engineer, not a historian. He served as the spokesperson of the self-proclaimed Sultan of Sulu, who died in Taguig in 2013.</p>
<p>For the record, the primary source for Lapulapu and the Battle of Mactan is not a Pinoy but an Italian—Antonio Pigafetta, chronicler of the Magellan expedition. Our story begins on April 26, 1521, when the son of Zula, minor chief of Mactan, presented two goats to Magellan. Zula, apologizing, said he could send more, if not for “the other chief Cilapulapu, who refused to obey the king of Spain.” Zula requested from Magellan a boatload of men to help him fight Cilapulapu. Against his better judgment and the advice of his officers, Magellan set off at midnight with a force of 60 men. They were accompanied by the “Christian King” Carlos (who was Humabon before baptism), with 20 or 30 balanghai (about 450-500 Cebuano warriors) as back-up.</p>
<p>Arriving in “Matan” (Spanish for “they kill”) three hours before dawn, Magellan issued an ultimatum to Lapulapu and his men: Obey the Spanish king, recognize the Christian King as their sovereign, and pay tribute. “Otherwise, wait and see how our lances wounded.” Lapulapu’s insolent reply: “We have lances of bamboo and stakes hardened with fire.” Magellan foolishly agreed to fight in the morning at Lapulapu’s request. Magellan assumed that Lapulapu was buying time to dig pits in between their houses for the Europeans to fall into. He did not consider the low tide in the morning, which meant Magellan’s ships could not get close enough for cannon fire to cover them. Ignorant of the terrain, his three boats were impeded by rocks and coral, making their crossbows too far out of range to be useful. From the original 60 men that set off, 49 jumped into the water, leaving 11 to guard the boats. Magellan told Humabon and his 30 balanghais not to intervene as his 60 men supposedly sufficed to subdue Mactan. He was in for a big disappointment.</p>
<p>Magellan divided his landing force of 49 into three divisions and were pitted, by Pigafetta’s reckoning, against 1,500 Mactanons. Common sense, which is not common, should have told Magellan to retreat as he was outnumbered 31 to one. Their arrows were deflected by native shields, and bullets from their muskets would not hit Mactanons who “would never stand still, but leaped hither and thither.” When a shower of arrows, wooden stakes, and bamboo spears, some with iron tips, rained upon them, Magellan ordered his men “to burn (20 to 30 of) their houses to terrify them (but) they were roused to greater fury.”</p>
<p>Magellan and his men were half-armored, protected only by helmet and breast plate. They waded waist-deep in unfamiliar waters while the Mactanons aimed at their legs. Hit in the leg by a poisoned arrow, Magellan ordered a slow retreat. All but six or seven ran for their lives back to the boats. Mactanons ganged up on Magellan; one knocked his helmet off, another hurled a spear in his face. Magellan was drawing his sword halfway when he was cut in the left leg by a cutlass that caused him to fall face down. Surrounded and outnumbered, he was finished off by spears and cutlasses.</p>
<p>Described by one source as an old man, Lapulapu was far from the beautiful half-naked man with six-pack abs memorialized in monuments. He did not kill Magellan in hand-to-hand combat as we imagine. He was not in the thick of the fight, but to him is credited the victory for this mismatched battle. History should never be left to politicians and engineers.</p>

		<p class="card-text">Bawat bagay ay may kanya-kanyang panahon; panahon ng pagsilang at paghihirap, panahon ng pagkamatay at ginhawa. Ito ang oras ng pagluluksa, ngunit ito rin ang oras ng pagbangon. (Midnight Believer / Flickr)</p>
	</div>
	
</div>
<p><span class="drop">I</span>to ang natutunan ko sa mga ospital, matapos ang ilang buwang pagdalaw kay Lolo: Sa tingin ko’y may takdang oras ang mga pasyente, at ang takdang ito ang makapagsasabi sa tsansa nilang gumaling. Kung ikaw ay lumaya sa pagkakapiit sa kama at maputulan ng posas ng mga nakakabit na IV bago ang markadong oras, tiyak ang iyong kalusugan. Ngunit kapag lumampas ka sa takdang panahon ng paglaya, may sentensya kang kamatayan sa hinihigaan.</p>
<p>Sinentensyahan na ang lolo ko, at isang taon makalipas, sinentensyahan na rin ang nag-iisa niyang lalaking anak. Masyado nang matagal si Lolo sa ospital, at bagaman sa bawat dalaw ay kailangan naming maging tagapagdala ng kasiyahan at buhay, alam kong sa bawat dagdag na araw na inilalagi niya roon at sa bawat Linggong bumibisita ako ay kabawasan sa pag-asang makakaalis pa siya. Di nagtagal, sinabi na rin ng mga doktor na wala na silang magagawa; masyado nang malala ang kanser, at hindi kakayanin ng kanyang katawan ang anumang operasyon.</p>
<p>Wala na ring magagawa ang mga magulang ko, maging ang mga kapatid at pinsan ng nanay ko. Hindi lang mga maysakit ang nakakaramdam ng kabigatan sa tuwing hinahatulan sila. May kakaibang bigat din ito para sa pamilya dahil sa huli, sila ang mawawalan, maiiwanan kung maipagkakait ang alagang kailangan ng pasyente. Ngunit wala kang magagawa kung ubos na ang kaya mong ibigay. At minsan, ang kabigatan sa pagkawala ng mahal sa buhay ay kaalwanan sa kanilang natitira sa mundo.</p>
<p>Tahimik ang lolo ko at hindi niya gusto ang atensyon noon pang malakas siya, at dinala niya ito hanggang sa magkasakit at maratay siya sa kama. Marahil nasa lahi ang ganitong ugali; tumanggi rin ang tito kong pagkagastusan siya nang siya naman ang magkasakit isang taon makalipas mamatay si Lolo. Siya rin kasi ang sanay na magbigay; lahat ng kita sa abroad ay ipinapadala sa pamilya, at may mga pagkakataong siya pa ang hihingi ng paumanhin kapag walang naibibigay sa aking allowance o load.</p>
<p>Marahil malay siyang nauubos na rin ang kayang ibigay ng kanyang mga kapatid, lalo’t hindi pa sila nakakabawi sa mga inutang at ginastos kay Lolo noong nakaraang taon. Kaya sa pagpapasya at pagtanggap ng tito ko, at marahil ng lolo, na igugol ang natitirang panahon sa kanilang bahay, hindi lang siguro kalayaan mula sa pananakit ng mga kalamnan ang idinalangin niya, kundi pati paglaya ng kanyang mga kaanak sa pagod at paghihirap, matugunan lang ang kanyang pangangailangan.</p>
<p>Kasalanan ba, kung sa pagkakataong malaman mong ihininga na nila ang huli ay siya namang pagbuga mo ng ginhawa? Nariyan ang hinagpis na wala na silang bumuhay sa’yo at nakasama mo, nariyan ang pangungulila sa pagkakaroon ng tila malaking butas sa pamumuhay magmula sa araw na ito. Ngunit posible kaya, na kapag sinasabi nating, “Salamat at hindi na siya nahihirapan,” ay sinasabi natin ito sa ating sarili? Nakakalungkot isiping wala na akong bibisitahin tuwing Linggo, ngunit may kagaanan sa kawalan ng iisiping bayarin sa ospital at mga gamot.</p>
<p>Kung minsan, ang kagaanan ay hindi lang dahil malaya na tayo sa mga pang-ekonomikong aspeto ng kanilang pananatiling buhay. Ang kaalwanan ay maaari ring dahil hindi na natin sila kailangang isipin o problemahin. May mga pagkakataong tayong mga maiiwan ang nangangailangan ng kalayaan mula sa kanila.</p>
<p>Sa pagkamatay ng nakababatang kapatid ng aking ama, matapos ang pagkatakot, dahil nalaman kong ako pala ang huli niyang nakasalamuha bago atakihin sa puso, ay pakiramdam ng ginhawa. Ginugol ng tito ko ang kalakhan ng kanyang buhay nang lulong sa alak. Kapag may tama’y wala sa sarili kaya hindi pinapapasok sa bahay; at kung hindi lasing, naghahanap ito ng maipapambili ng bote o di kaya’y nangangapitbahay, nangangapit-inuman sa kabilang barangay. Hindi ko siya ginustong mamatay, at maging mga kapatid niyang tinitiis na lang siya ay hindi rin ito gustong mangyari. Ngunit sa totoo lang, tila maging siya ay wala na ring tinitingnan pang matinong kapalaran.</p>
<p>Gusto natin, at gagawin natin ang lahat ng paraan mapanatili lang na buhay ang minamahal, ngunit kung masyado nang mabigat, tingin ko’y hindi naman nila tayo masisisi. O kung hindi man, at galit nga sila dahil sa mga naramdaman ko, malaya silang parusahan ako, ipadama sa akin ang naranasan nila.</p>
<p>Ganoon siguro talaga kapag limitado ka. Palagay ko’y hindi ko naman ito maisusulat kung may sapat kaming yaman upang maipagamot sa pinakamagagandang pasilidad ang mga kaanak at magkaroon pa rin ng sapat na pera para naman sa sarili naming kinabukasan. Marahil ang madaling pagtanggap sa kamatayan ay bunsod na rin ng pagmimistulang normal ng mga pagkawala ngayong may pandemya. Sa sunod-sunod na pagkamatay ng dating mga kaibigan at mga kakilala dahil sa hindi matugunang krisis, mas dama natin ang pagiging limitado. Kaya madaling tanggapin ang pagkawala, ngunit mananatili minsan ang poot dahil wala tayong nagawa para sa kanila.</p>
<p>Ang sabi, pantay-pantay ang lahat sa kamatayan, ngunit maiiba siguro ako. Maaaring iisa ang kahahantungan ng lahat, ngunit hindi pare-pareho ang estado ng mga taong iiwanan natin. Ang mayayaman marahil, kapag namatay, ay mamamatay nang walang alinlangan. Ngunit para sa aming nangangailangang ibuhos ang lahat ng ari-arian sa pagpapagamot sa pamilyang mawawala rin, lilisan siguro sila nang may pangamba at baka sisihin pa ang sarili dahil iiwan niya ang pamilyang ubos na.</p>
