<p>For all the <a href="http://www.pulseasia.ph/february-2021-nationwide-survey-on-covid-19/">grim polls</a> and hectoring public health advisories, the Philippines has hardly even had to contend with vaccine hesitancy, which many government officials have for months flagged as a major challenge to combating the coronavirus. But the scale of such a problem is yet to be seen at this point, really, when the object of speculation has scarcely materialized. So far it is not the <a href="https://phkule.org/article/115/how-to-think-about-vaccine-hesitancy-among-filipinos">public attitude to vaccines</a> that is at issue, when the government, by their own dawdling and bungling, does a better job than any conspiracy theory at losing what little confidence the people have in the vaccination program.</p>
<p>Vaccine skeptics make for an easy punching bag, though. &ldquo;May mga iba d’yan na ayaw talaga magbakuna. E, di okay na lang ‘yan sa akin. Ang problema kung makahawa ka,” President Rodrigo Duterte said in a televised speech, April 15. He dissed them and told them to die five times.</p>
<p>Duterte offered a lecture on how to get away with a botched job. First, as in an April 13 speech, he deflected the blame, through cartoonish, frenzied fallacies, to boogeymen and scapegoats only Duterte could think to bring up: communists, whose opposition to the national ID system he claimed to have hampered the pandemic response; flying voters, who he said made it harder for local governments to parcel out COVID-19 aid; and the United States and company that are “refusing to understand or causing problems for other nations.” It did not take long for vaccine skeptics to go on Duterte’s chopping block.</p>
<p>Next, the president had members of the national task force on COVID-19 flaunt facts and figures so carefully picked out to paint a picture of efficiency and competence. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. reported, during Duterte’s pre-recorded meeting with Cabinet members on April 19, that the country ranked third in Southeast Asia, just behind Indonesia and Singapore, in terms of the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered, as per data from Bloomberg and the Foreign Service Posts.</p>
<p>“Maganda ang record natin despite unfounded criticisms… to think people were almost in a quandary where to get the next vaccination,” Duterte said. “Nakita mo naman, hindi pala tayo yung pinakamahina.”</p>
<p>Yet the numbers are only as impressive as the government’s effort to skate over its ineptitude and the magnitude of the challenge at hand. The roughly 3.025 million doses delivered to the Philippines, as of April 17, make up only about two percent of the government’s target of 148 million vaccine doses to procure. Granted the administration has eight more months to keep pace with its own timeline, it should still have, by now, gathered enough momentum to roll out the six batches of vaccines already on hand.</p>
<p>We cannot fault officials for setting an ambitious goal, but nor can we congratulate them on a pandemic response so riddled with missteps and mistakes. While the economy craters and Filipinos grow restive, the Duterte administration has found itself navigating bureaucratic mazes of its own making and, along the way, failed to leap on vaccine deals that could have gotten the country to the front of the queue.</p>
<p>Rich countries have indeed tended to corner and stockpile COVID-19 vaccine supplies that are nowhere near enough to satisfy the global demand, notwithstanding regulatory hurdles and shortages of raw ingredients and machinery. Duterte struck a similar note, if erroneously, when, in February, he blamed the European Union for holding AstraZeneca doses hostage despite the <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/video/news/02/03/21/eu-philippines-exempted-from-vaccine-export-ban">country’s exemption</a> from the bloc’s export control. &ldquo;We are not rich,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is a fight among the highest bidders who can pay first.”</p>
<p>Even before this mad scramble, however, the government had already thrown away a shot at first dibs. It sat for almost five months, since June, on a confidentiality data agreement, the first in a bunch of paperwork to sort out prior to any vaccine purchase deal with Pfizer, a frontrunner in the vaccine race. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III has since <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/17/20/duque-denies-causing-delay-in-access-to-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine">defended the delay</a> with confused references to a supposedly thorough back-and-forth between Pfizer and Philippine officials and to documents shuttled between “relevant technical offices,” as he so told <em>ANC’s Headstart</em> in December.</p>
<p>But to chalk red tape up to a matter of erring on the side of caution, like Duque maintained, flies in the face of the deadly tradeoffs of such wavering. Other countries long anticipated the sort of panic-buying and marauding that had frayed global supply chains during the pandemic’s height. They clinched late-stage vaccine candidates, though they might strike out with several of their purchases, with most jabs’ efficacy still up in the air. Dud vaccines, after all, could just be tossed out. They would always be much cheaper than the possibly millions more lives squandered if there were no vaccines to go around at all as new surges and virus variants cropped up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for all Duterte’s insistence that only vaccines could rescue us from a life in lockdown, the Philippine government refused to go big. Its war chest would only pay for where there is a chance at profit and power play, as in big-ticket infrastructure projects and militarist campaigns. We are not deficient in funding, what with P75 billion of the P82.5 billion budget for vaccines in 2021 already “<a href="https://www.dof.gov.ph/dof-assures-public-of-sufficient-funds-for-covid-19-vaccination/">in place</a>,” according to the Department of Finance in January. Much of it will come from international financial institutions like the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, on top of the funds allocated under Bayanihan 2 and this year’s P4.5-trillion national budget.</p>
<p>Commitments from multilateral lenders may foot the bill for advance payments to their vaccine makers of choice. This would skirt the 15-percent limit on advance payments, consistent with the government procurement rules, that had precluded both the Duterte administration and local authorities from paying at least 50 percent of advance market commitments that pharmaceuticals require for vaccine reservations. Only in February, after much prodding, did Duterte sign an order lifting such a cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to queue, and we are last to queue because of our failure to make the advance payments early enough,” Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon told <em>ANC&rsquo;s Headstart</em> <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/22/21/mismanagement-to-blame-for-delay-in-covid-19-vaccines-arrival-says-drilon">in February</a>. &ldquo;Just like the way the COVID-19 pandemic was handled, there’s mismanagement in the handling of the supply agreements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drilon belied what pandemic managers pointed out, then, as a bottleneck with Congress and the Senate in passing a bill for an indemnification fund and a “no-fault” clause as part of the negotiations with the World Health Organization (WHO) and Gavi, two of the organizations leading the COVAX facility, a global vaccine-sharing pool. Galvez and Duque, as well as presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, separately imputed the <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/11/21/documents-snag-arrival-of-pfizers-covid-19-shots-in-philippines-palace">stalled COVAX-facilitated shipment</a> of Pfizer&rsquo;s coronavirus shots, in mid-February, to the manufacturer’s allegedly last-minute demand for indemnification to preempt lawsuits similar to what the Aquino administration had pursued against another drug company, Sanofi, over the Dengvaxia scare.</p>
<p>Yet it was Galvez who <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1399375/senators-urgency-of-indemnity-law-raised-only-in-february">failed to alert lawmakers</a> to the urgency of COVAX prerequisites of which the WHO and Gavi, as early as November, had already informed all participating countries. They were not picking on the Philippines. Our task force negotiators simply exercised no due diligence, let alone assumed any sense of accountability for gaffes that cost us time and resources we could barely eke out.</p>
<p>Accountability is, however, a tall order for a president who has shunned political acumen and appears just as lost about the policies he himself has signed into law. “I think we cannot even do that even if we wanted to, assuming liability for the stuff bought by the provinces. Tell them it cannot be,&rdquo; Duterte told Galvez in a March 22 speech, rejecting the concept of liability shields in tripartite agreements. By then, however, he had already <a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/duterte-signs-law-speeding-up-vaccine-purchase-creating-indemnity-fund">signed off</a> on a bill ratified by Congress providing for just exactly that.</p>
<p>The odds of weathering this public health crisis sane and unscathed can swing either way, depending on one man’s caprices and comprehension of risks and reality at any given time. Though we can, and must, brave out the pandemic, through sheer will and mutual aid, if nothing else, the more lingering emergency is what Duterte represents and has set out to foment and leave behind as soon as the dust settles.</p>
<p>Even now, his allies in the national pandemic response team, who may remain long after Duterte leaves the political stage, seem to take after him, in rhetoric if not in deed. With political chutzpah and self-righteousness, they recast all sorts of actors—Duterte’s predecessors, the communists, critics, anti-vaxxers, rich economies—as stupes and bullies and villains out to foil their best-laid plans. Criticisms are taken and chewed out as vehement spins and infantile tantrums. Then, always on the defensive, they would refuse to level with the public and rather report out and dwell only on drop-in-the-bucket accomplishments.</p>
<p>Sure, we cannot expect the government to cite, say, the <a href="https://interactives.lowyinstitute.org/features/covid-performance/">pandemic response index</a> released by Lowly Institute, a Sydney-based think-tank, that ranked the Philippines as 79th out of 98 countries evaluated using indicators such as COVID-19 deaths and confirmed cases as a proportion of tests. Losers, though self-aware, rarely admit they choked. It pays to be honest, though, to own up to the blunders made and to reckon with their far graver implications down the line should they remain unaddressed.</p>
<p>Matters of policy and life and death do not afford us the luxury and hollow spectacle of self-preening speeches.  While Duterte has once described the country’s vaccination program as sluggish and fitful, this is not an admission of culpability so much as pointing out the obvious. His anodyne assurances and trollish threats can only do so much.</p>
<p>So far, as of writing, only around 1.46 million doses from China’s Sinovac and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca have been given and still failed to cover the 1.7 million health care workers who are on top of the priority list and whom Galvez said would have been inoculated by the end of the first quarter. The limited doses barely deterred several government officials from <a href="https://phkule.org/article/77/from-smuggling-to-line-jumping-a-rundown-of-everything-that-is-wrong-with-the-philippines-vaccination-drive">jumping the line</a>—a clear violation of the terms of the COVAX program, according to WHO Philippines representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, that could force the facility to withhold from the country millions of free shots in the pipeline.</p>
<p>By contrast, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations">vaccine rollout in Myanmar</a>, still in the throes of a military coup, has even fared more swimmingly, with about two per 100 people having received at least one dose of the jab. There is nowhere to go but up, so the platitude goes. But we cannot underestimate the Duterte administration’s willingness to imperil the wellbeing of thousands, the breadth of its recklessness and indifference, its capacity to set us back even farther and to plunge the country deeper into an economic slump.</p>
<p>Duterte, captive of his own cockeyed politics, has still over a full year to either redeem or reprise what has so far been a malign and unavailing pandemic performance. Our expectations could go much lower at every turn. His latest slip in a speech on April 19 hardly inspires trust. At one point he asked everyone in the room what else was on the agenda. Someone coached him. “Ah, itong COVID? Oh, well,” he said. A leader who regards as an afterthought a pandemic that continues to convulse communities and customs offers no salvation. It is every vulnerable life and embattled institution that needs saving from him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope.” &ndash;Bernard Williams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Death, Disease, hunger, bankruptcy, face masks, face shield, ICU. All these words have barged into our daily vocabulary like a thief in the night.</p>
<p>The global devastation brought about by COVID-19 has left us all in a zombie-like-state-worthy of a Stephen King novel. And just like the state of the world, our country is reeling, faltering from the severe effects of the global pandemic which has claimed the lives of over 3,000,000 people around the world.</p>
<p>The darkness of uncertainty looms over us like a lion ready to devour its prey. We are all afraid. Governments and scientists alike have poured everything they have into developing a cure, a vaccine, medication.</p>
<p>Some through desperation have tried alternative drugs to help combat the spread, but what is the real virus, is it the coronavirus? Or is it fear?</p>
<p>Whatever your opinion maybe, the fear is real.</p>
<p>Yet, from a small street aptly named Maginhawa seems to be making a real dent in the war against the deadly virus and its effects. Yes, the Filipino spirit is at it again, there is something about the blood of this culture that is stubborn, hard-headed and would not seem to back down when their backs are against the wall.</p>
<p>A new buzzword has invaded our mouths, this time as a real glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>The community pantry, an old table on top of it are daily necessities for anyone to take and give freely. This revolution has spread faster than any corona variant can, tables and food of all kinds given by the needy, taken by the needy.</p>
<p>No frills, no lights no cameras,  no announcements, no midnight speeches, nothing but pure unadulterated caring. From one human being to the next.  This is a whole new People power movement to topple the status quo of hunger, unemployment and brutal loss that has hounded us for more than a year. Even when government raises its hands in defeat, the Filipino spirit will not lay down and die. The simple act of kindness is in reality a massive act of defiance screaming, NO, we will not be defeated, whatever you may bring, we will look after each other no matter what.</p>
<p>The community pantry movement has faced criticisms, stemming from forces that are supposed to be bound by duty to serve we, the people. But like in every bunch, there will always be a few bad apples, but those bad apples will soon realize that they are in an orchard of selflessness. Whether it influences them or not, only time may tell.</p>
<p>Despite the positive movement,  labels have been surfacing such as communists, rebels, and others too shallow to even discuss. But I, as a simple citizen challenge you, no matter the threat, no matter the label, no matter the propaganda given by our so-called leaders, we should be the change that the world will see.</p>
<p>This uprising has given us many inspirational stories, such as Ana Patricia Non, who at 26 years old has probably seen a steep rise in hunger, desperation and hopelessness. She is the initiator of the first Community pantry. Bravo to her, don’t backdown from the evil that persecutes you Ma’am, we are with you. Then there is Alberto Calanza, 52 a chicharron and balut vendor, who despite his limited income still found it in his heart to donate three packs of noodles. In addition to this, there is also Manong Romeo who one day, passed the community pantry in their district only to find it closed; instead of asking for goods, he gave 46 pesos in small change as a donation from selling metal scrap. Countless stories are sprouting on social media about regular folks making a difference in the country.</p>
<p>All the stories, smiles and joyful tears coming from this movement, kind of reminds me of something that happened long ago when a rebel received 5 loaves and 2 fish and the multitude was fed.</p>
<p>As of today, the Maginhawa community pantry has sprouted into hundreds of locations feeding many of our countrymen. Not only that, it has even influenced other countries such as Timor-Leste who have put up their own community pantry to relieve their citizens from the effects of devastating floods. We are setting an example to those who have abandoned us in the midst of this pandemic, we don’t need the empty promises, worthless initiatives and now even the childish name calling, the Filipino will always look out for each other.</p>
<p>While the dreaded virus is still upon us, absolute precautions should still be observed, and most importantly we should realize and recognize that there are heroes in each of us that can ease the burden that this pandemic has brought. Who would have thought a simple act of kindness could spread like a wild fire as hope takes centerstage after the spotlight has been on despair for quite a while?</p>
<p>The Philippines still shows the world of its unmatchable heart, unconditional caring and soon, we will change what the perspective of the world was, from the sick man of Asia to the hope of the world.</p>

<p><span class="drop">I</span>t began in an outdoor tent of all places. I remember being a wide-eyed kid in the fifth grade browsing awkwardly through the titles on display at the Scholastic book fair that seemed to have magically popped up at my school one morning. Because I did not have money then, the salesclerk gave me a piece of paper bearing the header “wish list” where I should, she said, write down the books I wanted and their corresponding prices so that I could show them to my parents later on. And so I did.</p>
<p>For a 10-year-old kid who never really had an experience with handling money, as my mom insisted on sending me to school with snacks instead of an allowance all throughout elementary, a couple of hundred pesos seemed like the world. I went to school the next day with a clear vision: I was going home with a new book that day. Thus began a lifelong affliction.</p>
<p>In the words I found worlds. Pretty cliché, I know. But I suppose this is a collective memory for us awkward adolescents who tried to escape the schoolyard drama by wallowing in the pages of fiction. Who among us did not fantasize about receiving a Hogwarts letter or suddenly waking up to a post-apocalyptic universe? Weird as these thoughts may be now, but growing up, books offered some semblance of comfort in the prospect of other worlds so different from this one.</p>
<p>I carried this relationship with the written word well into high school. I used to save up a portion of my allowance for my weekly mall trips, where, by default, the first stop would either be National Book Store—back when it was more books and less store—or Booksale, with its allure of cheaper second-hand titles stacked somewhat haphazardly all over the place.</p>
<p>Naturally, our high school’s library became a sort of sacred spot for me, part refuge, part place for adventure. It was extremely small and cramped, but it was, in a way, the biggest part of the school with all the worlds it contained. I spent so much time there that the librarian found it fitting to leave me its keys at times, making me something sort of an unofficial school librarian (which came in handy whenever I needed to use the library printer for the schoolwork I so often crammed).</p>
<p>But when I entered UP and became inducted to its long tradition of malicious overthinking, even the act of reading and buying books became an area for problematization. I remember my freshman English professor expressing her disdain for copyright and outright advocating for the piracy of texts. That she was an accomplished writer who wanted people to pirate even her works seemed strange to me at the time, a sort of discordant position I could not readily reconcile in my mind.</p>
<p>In a Filipino class, I distinctly recall a heated discussion on why Filipinos consistently rank among the lowest in global reading comprehension surveys—a reality made so painfully clear by a 2020 DepEd report detailing how a staggering 70,000 elementary students in the Bicol region alone cannot even read. What does it mean to be a reader in a country where a sizable chunk of the population remains illiterate, impoverished, and probably starving, too?</p>
<p>For the longest time, my ever-growing pile of books, now numbering in the hundreds but some remaining unread even after years since purchase, has been a source of both pride and guilt. There is, as Edgar Calabia Samar so beautifully put it, an everyday sadness in knowing one is not reading enough. But the stack of unread books also serves, as Umberto Eco first pointed out, as a tangible reminder of how much we still do not know—an instant source of intellectual humility that runs counter to the predilection to complacency we in the educated class tend to fall into the trappings of.</p>
<p>More recently, a mix of middle-class guilt and the steady socio-political conscientization I got from the university both inside and outside the classroom made me look at my book collection in a different, more critical light. The image of Smaug from Tolkien’s The Hobbit came to mind, the greedy dragon who sits lazily atop his massive pile of wealth while proudly declaring that he will not part with a single piece despite not having any immediate use for the treasure.</p>
<p>But I know the burden of democratizing knowledge lays not in those who have hoarded piles of the written work. How many other children would have been bookworms had their parents earned enough money to send a couple of hundred pesos with them to the next book fair that pops up? Or simply had access to a functioning school library. To borrow words from the poet Conchitina Cruz, the aforementioned English teacher: “It is more crucial to foreground the inherently restrictive role of material conditions in the activity of reading any kind of literature. The ordinary Filipino cannot afford to be a reader.”</p>
<p>These days when Zoom calls force us to share a snapshot of our domestic situations, bookcases seem to have become a popular video call background, owing, perhaps, to the fact that book ownership is an acceptable way to signal one’s capital, whether cultural or otherwise. Truth be told, it takes an extraordinary amount of privilege to be able to not just afford books but actually have the time to read them in this society that values a myopic view of productivity over leisure, profit over welfare.</p>
<p>The challenge for the educated class, then, is to find ways to use our talents and skills—the cultural capital we accrued from having free time, thanks to the labor of others—to democratize the society that allows for both book-hoarding and illiteracy simultaneously. Doing so necessitates a more equitable distribution of wealth, there is no other way around it. Books are meant to be read, and our books deserve more readers.</p>

<p>As tensions with China continue to grow, Japan is making moves to join the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance. This week, Japan’s ambassador to Australia, Shingo Yamagami, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/japan-should-join-five-eyes-intelligence-network-says-ambassador-20210420-p57kv6.html">told</a> The Sydney Morning Herald he was “optimistic” about his country coming on board. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I] would like to see this idea become reality in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This comes as New Zealand <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australia-was-blindsided-when-five-eyes-ally-new-zealand-backed-away-from-china-criticism-20210421-p57l5d.html">voices its concerns</a> over using the Five Eyes process to pressure China. </p>
<p>What is this spy alliance? And what are the benefits and risks to bringing Japan on board? </p>
<h2>What is the Five Eyes?</h2>
<p>Beginning as an intelligence exchange agreement between the United States and United Kingdom in 1943, it formally became the UKUSA Agreement in 1946. The <a href="https://www.dia.mil/News/Articles/Article-View/Article/1861392/this-week-in-dia-history-formation-of-the-fvey-partnership/">agreement then extended</a> to Canada in 1948, and Australia and New Zealand in 1956. </p>
<p>This long-running collaboration has been particularly useful for sharing <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/about/faqs/sigint-faqs/">signals intelligence</a>, or intelligence gathered from communications and information systems. The group’s focus has shifted over time, from targeting the USSR during the Cold War, to Islamist terrorism after the September 11 attacks in 2001, to the rising challenge from China today.</p>
<h2>Japan’s intelligence infrastructure</h2>
<p>There is a significant intelligence tradition in Japan. After the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/japan/meiji-restoration">Meiji Restoration</a> of the 19th century, the imperial Japanese army and navy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs developed extensive intelligence networks. These aided the rise of the Japanese empire in its wars against China, Russia and eventually the <a href="http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/publication/kiyo/pdf/2009/bulletin_e2009_2.pdf">Western allies in the second world war</a>. </p>
<p>After the war, Japan’s intelligence services were revamped under American supervision. Japan has since been an <a href="https://www.afcea.org/site/sites/default/files/files/US%20signals%20intelligence%20(SIGINT)%20activities%20in%20Japan%20_%20A%20Visual%20Guide.pdf">important base</a> of operations for US intelligence operations in Asia, particularly by military intelligence, the CIA and the National Security Agency.</p>
<div data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props="{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1384772893154766854&quot;}"></div>
<p>The Japanese intelligence community now comprises a <a href="https://isdp.eu/publication/development-of-japans-intelligence-policy/">range of services</a>, including the Ministry of Defense’s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/05/19/japan-dfs-surveillance-agency/">Directorate for Signals Intelligence</a>, which provides expertise in regional signals intelligence. Given Japan’s proximity to China, North Korea, and Russia, Japan may well be an attractive addition to the Five Eyes alliance. </p>
<p>There is also a precedence for formal intelligence sharing with the West. As well as its long-running collaboration with the US, an <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/announce/announce/2012/5/0517_01.html">Information Security Agreement</a> was signed between Australia and Japan in 2012. At the end of 2016, the US, Japan and Australia signed a similar <a href="https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2016-Australia-Japan-U-S-Trilateral-Information-Sharing-Arrangement-Signing.pdf">trilateral agreement</a> deepening the extent of covert security cooperation.</p>
<p>Japan’s close relationship to the US is seen in Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s visit last week to the US, the first foreign leader to be officially hosted by President Joe Biden. The talks in Washington <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2021/05/07/joe-biden-sees-japans-yoshihide-suga-new-ally-chief-china-tensions-rise-1584541.html">focused heavily</a> on China. </p>
<h2>Previous reluctance to expand the group</h2>
<p>While the Five Eyes group has often cooperated with the intelligence services of Japan on an ad hoc basis — as well as those of France, Germany and Israel — there has so far been <a href="https://www.technadu.com/5-eyes-9-eyes-14-eyes/39452/">reluctance among the Five Eyes members</a> to formally broaden the alliance. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://cis.mit.edu/news-media/news/2019/japanese-spies-once-renowned-have-fallen-hard-times">US especially</a> has had doubts in the past about the security and reliability of the Japanese intelligence community. In particular, this is <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/d00654/">due to concerns</a> over its relative lack of overseas experience.</p>

<p>In 2013, the Abe government passed a controversial <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2013/12/31/258655342/japans-state-secrets-law-hailed-by-u-s-denounced-by-japanese">Designated State Secrets Law</a> to reduce these vulnerabilities and present Japan as a more valuable security partner. The ensuing revamp of the intelligence services, under firmer central direction of a National Security Council, has <a href="https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2015_RP02_skk.pdf">reformed Japan’s capabilities</a> to some extent.</p>
<p>But further complicating matters, New Zealand has now shown <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-19/new-zealand-five-eyes-intelligence-sharing-china-australia/100078834">its hesitancy</a> about using Five Eyes to pressure China.  This threatens to undermine the unity and stability of the alliance, even raising the prospect of New Zealand leaving Five Eyes altogether.</p>
<h2>What about China?</h2>
<p>Japan’s relationship with China — its neighbour and main trading partner —  could potentially be a stumbling block. This relationship was managed fairly successfully under the Abe government, where the mutual benefits of trade and investment were prioritised. </p>
<p>This has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3102402/japans-new-pm-seen-balancing-us-china-ties-despite-calls-closer">largely continued</a> under Suga, but more hawkish members of the government are starting to push a tougher line against China.  </p>

<hr>
<p>With the ongoing territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands, and more assertive demonstrations of force by the People’s Liberation Army, <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/09/71e56394f329-focus-china-wary-of-japans-pro-taiwan-new-defense-ministers-moves.html">relations between China and Japan</a> have become much frostier. As Japan is on the “frontline” with China, becoming a Five Eyes member has the potential to improve its strategic position via stronger support from its alliance partners. </p>
<h2>Leadership change in Japan?</h2>
<p>The best prospect for Japan joining Five Eyes probably lies with cabinet minister Taro Kono. He is the minister for administrative reform, responsible for supervising Japan’s COVID-19 <a href="https://theconversation.com/japan-is-facing-a-fourth-covid-wave-and-sluggish-vaccine-rollout-will-it-be-ready-for-the-olympics-158700">vaccine rollout</a>. In his previous tenure as defence minister, Kono was <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Japan-wants-de-facto-Six-Eyes-intelligence-status-defense-chief">enthusiastically in favour</a> of Japan joining Five Eyes. </p>
<p>The energetic, media-savvy and ambitious Kono is widely favoured to replace Suga as prime minister if he does not survive a vote for leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in September. An <a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20210118/p2a/00m/0na/018000c">election for the lower house</a> of the Diet (Japan’s parliament) also must be held by October. </p>
<h2>Security environment could make the decision</h2>
<p>A more threatening security environment overall may hasten the push towards a “Six Eyes” anyway. </p>
<p>A cyber attack on the Australian parliament in 2019 was <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/china-reportedly-behind-cyber-attack-on-australian-parliament-and-political-parties">implicitly blamed on China</a>, while the US counterintelligence establishment is still reeling from the consequences of the massive <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/988116668/russia-retaliates-against-bidens-new-sanctions-expelling-10-u-s-diplomats">Russian SolarWinds cyber attack</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/988116668/russia-retaliates-against-bidens-new-sanctions-expelling-10-u-s-diplomats">Moscow’s interference</a> in the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections.</p>

<hr>
<p>This week, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police have blamed the People’s Liberation Army for organising hundreds of cyber attacks on Japanese companies, universities and government departments, including Japan’s space agency JAXA. This <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20210420_22/">is certain</a> to harden opinion against China.</p>
<p>If all members agree, especially with encouragement from the US, it would be fairly straightforward for Japan to formally join the Five Eyes. If the regional security environment continues to deteriorate, the declaration of a Six Eyes alliance incorporating Japan would be a clear diplomatic signal of a determination to confront China in intelligence and espionage.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

<p>Flaunting an inconsistent mouthpiece of Malacañang Palace, Harry Roque seems to have really adapted the absurd habit of his master: slipping his tongue and taking it back after a while as he said that the Philippines has been on a prolonged vacation due to the coronavirus pandemic. For that, the government then found a way to revoke this so-called ‘vacation’ and to reopen our lost economy –reclassify three holidays as special working holidays, which is totally unsympathetic to every Filipino laborer.</p>
<p>So the truth reveals, the administration only sees this whole pandemic, the series of imposed community quarantines, the loss of jobs of over a million workers, the deaths of numerous businesses, the sufferings of each household figuring how they could eat their next meals and such, as a mere vacation! It must be the reason why they do not do their services with due diligence rather than just ‘gross incompetence’ (as Senator Sotto described), to render for the Filipino people. Yet, our laborers never rested nor even have their peace of mind; they have lost their opportunities to earn a living.</p>
<p>This conflict in labor and employment has undoubtedly struck the Philippine economy. And now that the state of work and service are slowly going back, although still far from normal, Duterte, under Proclamation 1107 amended the list of holidays and special days for 2021 declaring November 2, December 24 and 31 as special working holidays to encourage economic productivity and minimize work disruption to recover from the adverse impact of the pandemic. As if the continuity of work is the issue, these special working holidays will just be ordinary working days but with commemoration –meaning they will no longer have an additional pay equal to the 30% of their daily basic wage.</p>
<p>Coming from positions of power, influence, and wealth, this is a huge insult to Filipino workers doing more than they should to provide for their families and keep themselves surviving during this pandemic that the current government is monumentally failing to address properly. They force Filipinos to perceive the struggle we face as a battle between economy and health when so many other countries in the world have managed to balance both aspects by implementing scientific solutions provided by the right and competent people.</p>
<p>This reflects how Duterte and his government managed the pandemic overall: through surface-level interventions that does not help the country in the long term, provide more suffering to ordinary workers, and to boast as if this is a solution that will benefit the country. Reasoning that it can stimulate the economy if work proceeds as usual during holidays, they seemed to have forgotten that an economy cannot fully function if the citizens and the workers have no money to spend. So, unsurprisingly, this move seems to favor the rich businessmen and employers who have more than enough to make it through this pandemic and even extravagantly celebrate the holidays while workers toil their duties, act as if it was a normal day, and to return home with improper compensation.</p>
<p>Not only the compensation is the case but also the chance of our workers to return from their home provinces during long holidays, as reasoned by Leni Robredo in her radio show. They barely have enough rest as they get a hold of their overwhelming workloads and the new normal set-up in workplaces, and celebrating those special occasions together with the family is what some workers are used to earning their relaxation. Taking it from them, does the government think of nothing? Aren’t they the ones who were unproductive in finding measures?</p>
<p>These holidays are also beneficial for overall mental health and peace of minds of Filipinos. In an environment as stressful as virtual work or physical work with extra rules imposed, breaks are badly needed. In fact, breaks and work pauses are proven to be helpful in increasing productivity and a healthy working mind. Why should the government limit this from a worker? It is pointless and abusive towards the people who choose to spend their holidays with their families and with themselves.</p>
<p>While countries like the United States, British Columbia, France, Virginia and others are raising their efforts for achieving a hundred percent mass vaccination, Duterte unbelievably had this insane proclamation signifying how much of a bully his administration is. It is their desperate act of not being able to think of a decent solution that the workers who have endured long enough are those who they insensitively let to torment more.</p>
<p>This is evident with how much Roque blames the public for the increase in COVID-19 cases because of not following the minimum public health protocols while also encouraging everyone to go out and spend and jumpstart the economy. Excusing their constant inconsistency, they are becoming hypocrites who will not, under any circumstances, admit their wrongs in implementing much more relevant rules that can actually help the country. While the public may not be 100% innocent in this case, it is still the government, who constantly changes the rules, increasingly loosening health policies, and then blames the public for surges in cases.</p>
<p>Now that they pretend to care about public health again because of the rise in cases, it is workers again who must suffer. For months, last year, they failed to implement a viable solution of balancing public health and preventing economic collapse despite their constant reassurances that the best and brightest in the government are working to find a solution. Now the burden falls again on workers to try to adjust and think of ways on how to survive.</p>
<p>Filipino workers have been greatly affected by this global health crisis. The reduction of special non-working holidays are not just a loss of their ‘supposedly additional pay’, but also of their actual rest with their families. The government boasts of their excellence in handling the pandemic yet they constantly fail to help those affected and their self-proclaimed achievements are yet to be felt by the citizens. If they have nothing to offer in boosting the economy apart from this, then they, who the incompetent and unproductive ones are, must resign and take a vacation away from national affairs that they cannot do right.</p>

<p><span class="drop">T</span>here was a time when the heroes people revered were nobodies. By nobody I mean one with no special or privileged status in society. Judging by the social standards of their (and our time) they were considered failures. Their conditions were often in the worse; they were familiar with all sorts of discomfort. They were masters of a certain tragedy of one kind or another.</p>
<p>Think of Jesus, a lowly carpenter in the poorest colony of the Roman Empire, who ended up on the cross. Socrates, a professional idler, ugly and pot-bellied, was forced to drink the hemlock. Diogenes, a cynic philosopher, lived in a wooden tub, and was not much impressed by Alexander The Great. The great Marxist philosopher and organizer Antonio Gramsci languished in jail. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X were assassinated by their fellow Afro-Americans. Many of the greatest poets and writers of the early 20th century were wiped out through purges and persecutions.</p>
<p>The Filipino national hero and martyr Jose Rizal did not earn a single centime from his two great books; and his short-lived profession as an ophthalmologist did not bring much profits because as he said most of his clients were “very poor.”</p>
<p>On account of their being a nobody, they were profound students and teachers of life. They were possessed by a seething spirit of grace to which the world owes marvelous acts of compassion, goodness, beauty, intelligence and imagination. Moving and poignant the lives they had led this old school class of heroes has today become quite unfashionable, untrendy; the values and causes they had embraced seem to violate our present culture’s extreme individualism and our learned obsession with comfort. They seem to us extreme to the extent that if they were alive today their presence would seem to kill the party.</p>
<p>Today the people we consider as heroes are nothing of the sort. They are the well-dressed billionaires, CEOs, Silicon Valley technocrats and the countless social media influencers who give us an endless stream of banality and ostentation. They would rather not be called a “teacher” for the word is far too mundane and an affectionate diminutive of the term minimum wage. So they prefer to be acclaimed as “life coach,” motivational speaker,” “guru,” “expert.” Unlike the heroes of the old school who were often deprived of banquets the heroes of the social media age are the familiar house guests of prestigious universities and schools, TV shows, podcasts, online talks (TED Talks), etc. They give countless speeches and interviews although they have nothing worthwhile to say. The young generations fall at their feet.</p>
<p>Because they bring the good news. You too can be successful; you too can be a billionaire; you too can be famous; you too can stand out from the rest of the unmotivated average lot. Their philosophy is not that difficult to follow because it’s all about the “me.” Their method can be summed up as follows: “10 steps to winning,” 12 rules of success,” “bring out the power of the inner you,” “the secret of greatness,” “how to stay hard,”… and so many other variation of this nonsense which I’m sure you’re familiar with.</p>
<p>In today’s culture, alongside heroism success is equated with genius. Status equals wisdom. A Tesla car is presented to the public with a touch of scientific enthusiasm comparable to the discovery of the theory of relativity and quantum physics. Elon Musk, whose inventions are nothing more than toys for the very rich, dreams of colonizing the universe. Any semi-educated person who has read a little of history will feel dread and disgust at the thought. As you (I assume) and I know, wherever we humans go we leave an endless trail of blood and destruction.</p>
<p>It is quite ironic that Musk’s company was named after a great scientist and inventor, Nikola Tesla whose inventions and developments influenced much of modern life (unlike Musk’s toys for the rich), dreamed of energy free for all and never amassed millions on the contrary died poor and abandoned by society.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs’ posthumous fame turned him into a saint and genius. Except that his genius required the collaboration of his brilliant assistants and the over-romanticization of his biographer and his saintliness did not count the sweatshop factories where the excessively overworked Chinese laborers (12 hours/day, 30 days per month) earn approximately 10.13 yuan/hour, or roughly $1.62 per hour, less than half the recommended living wage of about 3.77 per hour. And saint Jobs didn’t give much thought whether the discarded computer parts of his genius invention ended up in our already too polluted oceans.</p>
<p>Bill Gates, the most loved nerd in the history of nerdom, friend and competitor of and as equally super rich as saint Jobs, has become hugely influential for his insistently annoying climate change sermons. The ubiquitous all-round expert has even written a  pretentious little book entitled, How To Avoid A Climate Disaster; such a moving rhetorical, evangelical advice from one of the third richest person in the world, who owns more private farmland than anyone else in the US, an avid collector of private jets and Porsche cars, living in a mansion large enough to house the climate refuges in the world. So he kindly preaches us average human beings to eat synthetic beef if we want to avoid an environmental catastrophe.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos, the king of the Amazon, also the king of tax evasion, who generously donates millions of dollars to government organizations but refuses to raise the minimum wage of his workers and threatens them if they attempt to join a union. But the king is generous enough to gift his subjects with surveillance bracelets just in case they become too indulgent and lazy. As to the social media influencers who are self-appointed experts on everything, I rest my case.</p>
<p>These personalities appeal to our present culture because they uphold the cult of success and winning. In a culture that abhors the failure, the simple, the quiet, and the loser, these billionaires are refashioned as heroes. If you don’t stand out, it’s your own fault, or you don’t work enough or you’re not motivated enough. No wonder they place value on the rags-to-riches and the pursuit of happiness story. Instead of demanding social and economic justice for communities they prefer to romanticize the individual’s hero’s journey. They appeal to the misguided young because they offer that image of power specially if the young were those who grew up in an economically-disadvantaged countries. Amassing billions may appear a worthy enterprise, a heroic feat to one who is constantly in financial struggle. But to arrive to such a position of wealth and power requires a great dose of indifference, apathy, cruelty, rapaciousness, and narcissism. The truth is the rich heroes of today have nothing of value to say. They are illiterate of genuine culture. They are detached from the everyday realities of average people like you and me. Their speeches may sound full of concern for humanity—yes, for as long as their wealth and privileges remain untouched.</p>

<p><span class="-text-pink"><strong>Para sa mga jelyen sa ibang planeta,</strong></span></p>
<p>Hindi ko alam kung paano bumati sa inyo pero hayaan niyong magkruk-kruk ako bilang panimula sa sulat na ito.</p>
<p>Bakit hindi niyo na lang kami sakupin para makaraos sa pahirap na administrasyong ito? Lagi lang kasi namin kayong nakikita na pasilip-silip sa kalangitan, tapos sabi’y 2012 sasakupin niyo kami pero 2021 na wala pa rin kayo. Mahal ba ang pamasahe mula sa inyo papunta rito sa’min?</p>
<p>Nakakapagod na rin kasi ang siklo ng buhay rito. May isang matandang lalaking pa-shy type na ayaw kuno tumakbo pero kalauna’y napilit din. Mga panahon iyon bago dumating ang sakuna. Heto kami ngayon, tulala, litong-lito habang binabasa ang mga katagang nakatanggap umano ng 91% approval rating ang matandang lalaki.</p>
<p>Lubha nga namang napakataas nito gayong sa higit ilang pangakong inilatag niya’y bilang lamang sa daliri ang masasabing tunay niyang nagawa. Naging tuntungan kasi nito ang dahas at ang paggamit ng kamay na bakal sa mga mamamayang tumutuligsa sa kanyang pamumuno – malinaw kung bakit ang lebel ng takot at pangamba’y kagyat na tumataas.</p>
<p>Nakapagtataka lang din na marami pa pala ang nagtitiwala sa kanya sa kabila ng patong-patong na alegasyon sa korapsyon, panunupil sa karapatang pantao’t maging sa bigo nitong pagtugon sa krisis-pangkalusugan. Aba’y lintek nga naman, oh.</p>
<p>Ta’s sabi pa ng iba riyan, “takot lang siguro sila kaya ganoon kasi mainitan ang ulo ng matanda.” Tunay namang matinik ang matanda sa mga tumutuligsa sa kanya, pero takot? Bakit ka matatakot kung paulit-ulit ka na niyang dinudusta? “Eh siyempre binabangasan niyo siya, kaya pupuntiryahin ka talaga!”</p>
<p>Hep, hep. Mali, tinutuligsa niya ang mga ito dahil hindi lang naman sila grupo ng mga “bumabatikos” sa kanya, hello, siyempre natatakot siya na mas lumalaki ang bilang ng mga Pilipinong nakikisangkot sa pagkilos, kapag mas maraming namumulat, mas uunti ang bilang ng mga mapaglalaruan niya sa kanyang daliri. In short, takot siya sa pananagutan, ganern!</p>
<p>Tiyaka, ano na bang bago sa kanya? Lagi naman niyang idinadaan sa mura at payabang, kulang naman sa gawa! Lagi pang mainit ang ulo lalong-lalo na kay Kumareng Leni na niraratsada niya palagi ng mga maling akusasyon at misodyinistikong komento. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Biruin mong 91% trust and approval rating, pero takot na maungusan ni Kumareng Leni kaya roon niya itinutuon ang galit. The old man talaga’y cannot find ways to alleviate his bruised ego. Oy, pak, english iyon, jelyen, google translate mo na lang.</p>
<p>Mabalik ako roon sa Pulse Asia, feeling ko dahil sa mga numero na iyan, nagiging mabango o sabihin na natin na pinababango ng mga numerong iyan ang imahen ng matandang lalaki na iyon. Tiyaka simula 2016 pa lang naman ay tinuring na silang ‘propaganda tool’ ng ilang mga maka-anti-Duterte lalo pa’t sa kabila ng mga isyung kinahaharap na ng matanda’y parang pinapabango nga nito ang imahe nito sa madla.</p>
<p>Tapos itong pandemya pa na pinalusog ang dependensya ng mga Pilipino sa pulitiko. Ipinapakita lang nito na dahil dito, nakokontrol nila ang mga tao. Patuloy niyang inaabuso ang pagkakataon na ito upang makapagpalakas at makaani ng katanyagan at suporta sa masa.</p>
<p>Idagdag mo pa itong paglabas nila ng mga napipisil na tumakbo para sa eleksyon sa 2022 kung saan nangunguna sa listahan ang anak ng matandang lalaki na si Sara, hindi ang munting prinsesang nagbabalat ng patatas, kung hindi si Sara, with no H, Duterte. Hindi ko na talaga alam.</p>
<p>Ayun, maghihintay ako sa tugon ninyo. Sana huwag ninyong i-snob. Excited na rin kasi akong makita kayo, at para naman masagot na rin ang tanong kung bakit ang tagal-tagal ninyo kaming sakupin. Taong 2012 palang ay handang-handa na kami. Gusto na rin kasi talaga namin makaraos sa paghihirap na ito.</p>
<p>Nagmamahal,<br>
<em><strong>Juan dela Cruz</strong></em></p>
<p><span class="-text-red"><strong>Para sa mga taong feeling kasakop-sakop,</strong></span></p>
<p>Nasa kamay ninyo ang himig ng inyong kalagayan sa lipunan. Hindi niyo ba batid na maaaring ginagamit lamang ang mga numerong ito upang linlangin ang inyong isipan?</p>
<p>Mataas ang trust at approval rating ng matandang lalaki, ibig sabihin nito’y babango ang kanyang imahe para sa karamihan, mas darami lalo ang hahanga sa kanya’t aangat ang lebel ng kanyang katanyagan sa kabila ng mga isyung kinahaharap. Sa kabilang dako, nariyan naman ang kanyang munting prinsesang si Sara na nangunguna sa mga napipisil na tumakbo para sa eleksyon sa taong 2022. Marahil kalakip nang pagpapabango ng imahe ni Duterte ay ang siya namang pagyakap nila sa sabihin na nating ibang telang hinabi sa parehong hiblang si Sara.</p>
<p>Mahuhumaling sa kanya ang mga tao, isang bagay na kritikal kung ikokonsidera natin ang sitwasyon sa bansa, na karaniwang nadadala ang tao sa bigat ng kanilang pangalan kaysa sa kanilang demokratikong paniniwala. Nawawala ang konsensya’t maging ang ipinatong na pananagutan dahil nadadala ang lahat sa numerong ipinapakita ng mga sarbey na ito na kung ‘di mapag-aaralan ay mas lalong magiging daan upang maipalaganap ang huwad na katotohanan.</p>
<p>Dahil dito, isa lamang ang maaaring makita, dahil sa kawalan ng pang-unawa, sa mga nababasang iisang mukha lang ang nakikita, hindi maipagkakaila na magiging ‘self-fulfilling’ ang mga sarbey na ito, “it rightly or wrongly spawns subliminal bias.”</p>
<p>Sa inilabas na ulat ng Pulse Asia, ba’t hindi nila inilatag ang bilang ng mga tumanggi na lumahok o kaya’y mga katanungang hindi nasagot? Sa paraang ito ay maaaring magkaroon ng ideya ang publiko kung lubos bang naapektuhan ng takot o posisyon nila sa pulitika ang lumabas na resulta. Maaari rin namang nakahimlay ito sa mga ibinatong katanungan lalo pa’t balita ko’y ang pinagbasehan lamang na ‘performance’ niya’y mula Hunyo hanggang Agosto, masyadong makipot para mapisil ang katas na hinahanap ng karamihan.</p>
<p>Ang ganitong uri ng mga pangyayari’y hamon sa bawat isa na hindi lang dapat magpadala sa kung anong numero ang inihahapag sa mesa. Dapat marunong din tayong alamin kung bakit ito kinuha, sino-sino ang pinagkuhanan, ano ang kanilang kinuha, at kung sa paanong paraan nila ito isinagawa. Isang patunay kung bakit ang matematika’y esensyal ‘pagkat hindi lamang ito sa numero bumabatay kung ‘di pati na rin sa pag-unawa sa mga lumalabas na resulta.</p>
<p>Kung magpapatuloy na maninindigan ang Pulse Asia sa 91% trust rating at approval rating ni Duterte, parang ginagawa na lamang nito ang kanyang sarili bilang mekaniko ng isang bulok na sistema. Sinesegunduhan ang mga mamamayan ng isang maling uri ng pagtitiwala.</p>
<p>Ngayon, hahayaan niyo na lang bang diktahan ng 1,200 respondente ang kapalaran ng milyong Pilipino? Hindi. Dapat sila’y managot.</p>
<p>Magiging mabunga lamang ang resulta ng mga ito kung sasagutin lamang ito ng tapat. Subalit, sa kasalukuyang kalagayan ng bansa, maaaring karamihan sa mga ito’y resulta lamang buhat ng takot o kohersyon kaysa sa kung ano ang nararapat.</p>
<p>Hindi dapat gamitin na rason ang resulta na ito upang maabswelto sila sa pananagutan hinggil sa lumalalang kalagayan ng karapatang pantao, korapsyon, at ang nababansot na kalagayang pangkalusugan ng bansa. Hindi dapat mabulag sa ‘high trust rating’ bagkus gamitin ang kakayahan na bumoto sa eleksyon sa taong 2022 para hatulan ang kanilang kapalaran.</p>
<p>Subalit masidhi na ang paghihirap at lantarang paglabag sa karapatan ng masa, hihintayin pa ba ninyo ang isa pang taon para makaalpas dito?</p>
<p>Hindi na dapat isaalang-alang ang buhay ng mga mamamayang uhaw na sa katiwasayan. Gamitin ito upang makapagpakilos at mangmulat ng mga indibidwal na niligaw ng kanilang paghanga. Talaga namang parang mala-Fangirl ang peg dito, si Paulo si Papa niyo Digz at si Jane ang die-hard fans nito.</p>
<p>Desperado na ang matandang lalaki sa katanyagan lalo pa’t kailangan nitong magpalawig ng kanyang galamay. Subalit ang desperasyon na ito’y hindi mag-uugat ng pagtitiwala kung ‘di mag-uugat lamang ng pagnipis ng pag-asang inaasam ng lahat.</p>
<p>Higit sa lahat, huwag sisihin ang mga biktima ng pang-aalipusta, huwag sisihin na kaya may mali kasi pinipilit ng tao na may mali. Kung maninindigan ka rito, parang ipinakita mo na rin na ika’y hinuhulma mula sa isang hiblang dugo ang bunga.</p>
<p>Okay na kaming makita sa KMJS o Rated K na pasilip-silip lang sa heaven. Alam kong gusto ninyong magpasakop pero hindi deserve ng extraterrestrial beauty ko ang bayan ninyo. At para makaraos? Hindi niyo kami kailangan.</p>
<p>At lalong-lalong hindi kami parausan.</p>
<p>Nagmamahal,<br>

	                <p>On April 7, The Conversation published <a href="https://theconversation.com/three-graphs-that-show-a-global-slowdown-in-covid-19-deaths-135756">three graphs</a> showing the rise of deaths from COVID-19 in seven countries. What we could not have known then was that April 7 was the point at which the peak, or at least the first peak, in mortality in England and Wales was reached. </p>
<p>Analysis from the <a href="https://ft.com/content/67e6a4ee-3d05-43bc-ba03-e239799fa6ab">Financial Times</a>, which includes deaths outside hospitals, has posited April 8 as the peak for COVID-19 deaths for the whole of the UK.</p>
<p>Here, those April 7 graphs are updated for Europe and geographical evidence is drawn together from around the rest of the world to try to paint a clearer picture of the direction in which we are heading – probably one where countries converge towards a single global death rate.</p>
<h2>England and Wales reach a peak</h2>
<p>First, the situation in England and Wales. The graph below shows the rise in mortality each day since the outbreak began, not just in hospitals, until April 9. The additional data is provided by the Office for National Statistics in its <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases">weekly reports</a>.</p>
<p>This graph and the one below are based on smoothed data, which uses a moving average for the period from the day before to the day after each date shown to better illustrate a trend.</p>

<p>The peak by this method of counting occurred on April 7 when the smoothed number of deaths recorded was 1,001, compared to 944 on April 6 were 879 on April 8. </p>
<h2>Rates of change in affected countries</h2>
<p>The graph above is conventional. The one below is a bit different. </p>
<p>It shows both the smoothed number of deaths each day but now also the rate of change in that number. And it adds data from seven additional country datasets: France, the USA, Spain, Italy, China, Germany and the UK as a whole. </p>
<p>These seven countries are highlighted because they originally had the highest number of deaths. The data is more up to date in this graph because it is mostly drawn from the most recent daily <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-covid-deaths-3-day-average">hospital data</a>.</p>

<p>The method of showing change used in the graph above was developed for my book, <a href="http://www.dannydorling.org/books/SLOWDOWN/">Slowdown</a>, which I worked on with illustrator Kirsten McClure who turned my crude Excel graphs into the clearer visual shown above. </p>
<p>It’s a useful way to look at data when you are trying to demonstrate change over time. When a line curves to the right, deaths per day are increasing. When it curves to the left, they are decreasing. Loops indicate a change in trend – so death rates rising, falling and rising again.</p>
<p>This graph shows the rise in mortality in seven countries up until April 20. By this point, the daily number of deaths was falling most days in most countries, although it had risen to be very high in the US. </p>
<p>Most intriguing is that from April 7 to 10, the shape of the curve for England and Wales, when all absolutely certain COVID-19 related deaths including in care homes are included, almost exactly matches that for France. This is significant because there is so much debate about how different European countries are doing, when in fact it is the similarities that are most remarkable.</p>
<p>In all the countries shown here, the fall in deaths may have begun a little earlier than the imposition of lockdowns would have suggested, although the lockdowns almost certainly accelerated the falls. </p>
<p>The looping effect was seen originally in China, and may suggest one outbreak superimposed upon another.</p>
<h2>The rest of the world</h2>
<p>The final graph shows the current <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/">fatality rates</a> of all those known to have the virus in the 21 countries that had conducted 10,000 tests by April 22, excluding the seven above. </p>

<p>It ranges from Singapore, where only one in 1,000 of all those who have tested positive have died, to Belgium, where 15% or almost one in seven have died. In Belgium, it is almost exclusively people who are very ill who are tested and so the mortality rate appears to be 150 times higher than in Singapore where a much wider range of the public has been tested. </p>
<p>But the real mortality rate of these two countries will end up being very similar, and much nearer to the lower end of the range. It is extremely unlikely that Singapore, with its very efficient health system, is failing to record the deaths of those known to have the disease.</p>
<p>This illustrates a key point: over time, all of these mortality rates will probably begin to converge on a single global rate of those who have caught the disease. This is what has happened in the past. The flu of 1918 may have had a mortality rate as high as 2% of all those who caught it. In contrast, the H1N1 flu of 2009 had a mortality rate 100 times lower at 0.02%. </p>
<p>For COVID-19, the final rate will <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-deadly-is-the-coronavirus-compared-to-past-outbreaks#Novel-coronavirus-(COVID-19)">tend to be towards the lower end</a> of the spectrum shown, if this disease is at all like previous pandemics, which we don’t know for sure yet. </p>
<p>The picture is complex. But these graphs tell us a few key things: England and Wales passed at least one peak on April 7. And, based on the second graph, it’s clear that rates have begun to cascade down in Europe. Across the globe, rates vary widely based on differing testing policies – but we can expect that they will converge around a single figure before too long.</p>

<p><span class="drop">T</span>he genetic identification of a novel strain of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019 appears to have entrenched a recourse to quarantine measures around the world. Wuhan, a city of over 11 million people, has been placed in a lockdown, borders have been closed, and a number of governments have instituted selective travel restrictions and prohibitions based on citizenship and legal status—including suspending visas to anyone with a Chinese passport.</p>
<p>NCoV—since renamed as COVID19—is a serious health issue, particularly for those already suffering from chronic and respiratory diseases. The effectiveness of quarantines, however, is doubtful, raising the question of what value there is to quarantines if it’s not public health.</p>
<p>There is political value in the quarantine for those who implicitly believe biological-racial purity is a condition of health, but there is also financial value in substituting a social approach to health and illness with a selective, nationalist model conducive to the development of patented treatments and private health insurance.</p>
<p>For some, the quarantine rationalizes xenophobia and calls for ethnonationalist separation. The United States government has imposed a travel ban—or, more accurately, significantly expanded its obsession with restricting the movements of nonwhite people. Drawing on a long history of anti-Chinese sentiment, the Australian government has prohibited the entry of noncitizens from China and proposed to transport Australian citizens—many of whom will have traveled to China to celebrate the New Year with relatives—directly into a period of confinement at the immigration detention center on Christmas Island. While major hospitals on the mainland are equipped to handle serious diseases and pandemics, the island detention center is not—and so, if anyone quarantined develops the disease, they will have to be flown to a major city hospital for treatment in any event. The effect of these policies on some 200,000 students (a proportion of whom are returning from China for the new academic year in Australia) is unclear but will be enormous. Some universities around the world have mandated a period of dormitory confinement; others—such as UC Berkeley—issued advisories implying that xenophobia was an understandable response (since retracted under pressure).</p>
<p>As with the extralegal approach pursued by the Australian government, the Philippines government has proposed the use of military facilities on Caballo Island and Fort Magsaysay as quarantine zones. The Russian government has moreover threatened “the deportation of foreign citizens if they have such a disease.” This use of citizenship status as a proxy for detecting COVID19 is likely to ensure noncitizens avoid seeking treatment for associated symptoms—and it is, in any event, unclear how deportation might minimize the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>These practices highlight what Howard Markel describes as “quarantine’s aggressive potential for harm.” The harm is—as Markel suggested in his history of the treatment of East European Jewish immigrants in New York at the end of the 19th century—exacerbated for those who happen to find themselves on the “other” side of a quarantine border; its spread cannot be restricted along those lines because a virus is neither synonymous with a group of persons nor can it be identified by a passport.</p>
<p>While the World Health Organization declared COVID19 a serious health emergency, it advised against closed borders as an effective means of handling the virus. It warned that “closing borders was probably ineffective in halting the transmission of the deadly novel coronavirus from China and could even accelerate its spread,” in part because punitive approaches make it that much more difficult for health workers to treat cases and track the spread of diseases.</p>
<p>Immigration detention emerged from the intertwined histories and techniques of quarantine confinement and prisons. For most of the 20th century, the use of the cordon sanitaire (or “sanitary cordon”) as a public-health measure had largely disappeared—relegated to agricultural protocols at airports and ports but otherwise lingering as the metaphorical accessory of racializing policy—as I discuss throughout my book Contract and Contagion (122, 131-332).</p>
<p>The reappearance of the cordon sanitaire since the late 20th century has occurred at the intersection of a number of changes. It has reemerged after decades of a decline of social understandings and treatments of health and disease—or, the privatization of health and the socialization of disease. Further to this, the development of genome sequencing and bioinformatics has made it possible to identify new strains of virus; yet while genetic identification may be important in the development of treatments for some diseases, the ability to identify and map new strains does not imply some postmodern quickening in rates of microbial mutation. And, not least, the resurgence of far-right politics around ethnonationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment have given credence to the fantastical idea that biological purity is a condition of health and life.</p>
<p>In what follows, I want to underline four interconnected points:</p>
<p><span class="drop">F</span>irst, claims that quarantines are effective in containing the spread of viruses such as COVID19 or improving rates of survivability are debatable. The general view is that they are counterproductive.</p>
<p>As for the aesthetics that bolster the apparent urgency of quarantine measures: Mathematical models of contagions might furnish dramatic, speculative visualizations of fractal spreads that are able to be restrained by the presumably solid lines of national borders—but they are not real-world, field-tested exercises. Similarly, the terms and numbers used to describe emerging transmissible diseases have become intense conduits of misinformation, as with the reception of the basic reproduction number, or R0. Treated by researchers as a useful but provisional numerical estimate for developing hypotheses about rates of infection, the initial circulation of one such R0 on social media was greeted as if it were evidence of an unfolding apocalypse. Moreover, the use of non-symptomatic proxies (such as nationality) as a means of detecting COVID19 was briefly promoted by the publication of a report which suggested that asymptomatic transmission was possible, but that study has “proven to contain major flaws and errors,” and wrong in its conclusions.</p>
<p>Measures other than quarantine have been found much more effective in preventing widespread contagion. In a lengthy review of the research on the comparative effectiveness of a number of measures (short of vaccines and antiviral drugs) to prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses—screening at entry ports, medical isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, and hand hygiene—the use of surgical masks and regular handwashing emerged as the most consistently effective set of physical interventions. The review also found that the medical isolation of symptomatic patients was important but that “global measures, such as screening at entry ports, led to a non-significant marginal delay.”</p>
<p>As one scholar from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has put it, “no one should think that there won’t be more cases” simply because there is a travel ban.</p>
<p>Yet even if one were to grant the dubious assumption that the transmission of diseases might be halted (or meaningfully slowed) through territorial restrictions on people’s mobility, the genomic identification of a new strain of virus—while accelerated by the introduction of automated genome sequencing—would invariably occur subsequent to its appearance. In any event, expenditure and focus on quarantine restrictions tend to represent a redirection of resources away from measures likely to be more effective in both the immediate and longer term.</p>
<p>That is, quarantines often exacerbate viral dangers, because they foster the illusion that the isolation of a virus is synonymous with (or achievable through) the territorial confinement of groups of people, whose confinement is determined not by whether they are symptomatic or diagnosed with a disease but by a purportedly preemptive measure that uses nationality and geography as a proxy for exposure.</p>
<p><span class="drop">S</span>econd, the resort to quarantines draws on the biological-racial understanding of nations as discrete organic entities and prevents or displaces a social understanding of health and disease. Quarantines promote the imagination of a conflict between the preservation of presumably well-defined biological categories (the human, the family, the nation, the race) and the viral proliferation of boundary-blurring contagions.</p>
<p>It is however doubtful that humans could have evolved without the species-jumping, recombinant action of bacterial genetics transmitted through viral infections. More to the point, all vaccines involve the modified administration of an infection, and immunization is only effective at the largest (rather than national) population scales.</p>
<p>While some media attention has focused on Wuhan’s “wet markets” as the scene of species jumping, the privatization of health care and the socialization of ill-health remains largely ignored as a contributing factor in both infection and mortality rates. As a recent study shows, just over half of those infected with COVID19 in Wuhan’s Jinyintan Hospital had prior underlying chronic illnesses—such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory-system diseases, or malignant tumors.</p>
<p>Further, China’s public health-care system was dismantled in the 1980s. This occurred during a period of rapid, fossil-fueled economic changes—and precipitated an enormous rise in (untreated) chronic illnesses, in particular respiratory, cardiovascular, and cardiopulmonary diseases, in a city with some of the worst air pollution in the world. Its air quality has an annual average PM2.5 concentration of over 120μg/m3. By way of comparison, the WHO stipulates an annual average below 10μg/m3, above which total, cardiopulmonary, and lung-cancer mortality have been shown with more than 95 percent confidence to increase.</p>
<p>Around 97 percent of the deaths presently attributed to COVID19 around the world have been recorded in Wuhan. China’s decentralized, commercially oriented health system and the lack of health-care coverage have, in all likelihood, worsened the impact of any single disease—as some have argued they already did during the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>It may be that the recent construction of dedicated hospitals represents an effort by parts of the Chinese government to expand health-care and insurance coverage—albeit under the administrative control of the military. Which is to say, it is also part of the evolution of a system in which increasingly precarious populations can only access what should be routine health care through their involvement in experimental emergency procedures—which may or may not increase their chances of recovery, but in which they bear most of the risks of (eventually) patented vaccine or other drug or biotechnical developments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the shares of a U.S. biotechnology company, Gilead Sciences, spiked after reports that it would be launching a trial of its antiviral drug (remdesivir) on some 270 patients in China who developed mild to moderate pneumonia after having been infected with COVID19. The WHO recently advised that there is as yet no evidence for the effectiveness of antiviral treatments. Some treatments may yet prove to be effective. But at present they are experiments, speculative endeavors that leverage desperation and are oriented toward the growth of private markets in patented drugs. Moreover, while the open sourcing of data is crucial to health care, there are few if any impediments to its mining for commercial products at a consequently lowered cost.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these and other mutually reinforcing systems, there is a broad financial value in substituting a social model of health and disease—which involves a complex understanding of disease transmission and the factors that contribute to illness and mortality rates—with a reductive model amenable to private insurance, the subsidized development of patented drugs or treatments, and the continuing externalization of the downward risks of harmful industries and practices that contribute to ill-health and mortality.</p>
<p><span class="drop">T</span>hird, therefore the combination of the declared emergency, quarantine confinement, and lower regulatory standards significantly diminishes the cost of human drug trials and inflates the value of and market for patented drugs. There is commercial value for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in (speculations on) the development of patented vaccines, antivirals, or broad-spectrum antibiotics through the spatial delineation and immobilization of a cohort of research subjects.</p>
<p>Indeed, the collapse of public health care in China was accompanied by the introduction of a system in which hospital administrators were permitted “to profit-earn from new pharmaceuticals and medical technologies (after strong lobbying by the relevant multinational corporations), with salary bonuses for the staff involved.” There are a range of industries and practices that can leverage quarantines for gain—the military, detention or security contractors, and those organizations that combine these things with quasi-medical emergency response teams.</p>
<p>As it happens, the Australian government has required anyone interned at Christmas Island to sign a waiver—presumably one that indemnifies the government and the private contractors who manage the facility in the event that internment results in infection or other health issues. In other words, the quarantine on Christmas Island will be little more than a means of observing people who are confined for the average time that it takes COVID19 to incubate—if, that is, the virus is present among those detained. It is difficult to see how this exercise might be distinguished from the techniques that would develop a virus among a group of test subjects, whose progression could be mined for data—given that anyone who falls ill, in any way, will have to be moved to a large hospital on the mainland for treatment.</p>
<p><span class="drop">F</span>ourth, and finally, there is political value—for some—in forging a seeming consensus around the purported necessity and urgency of authoritarian population-control measures and restrictions on mobility, one that both is grounded in and fosters the stigmatization of groups of people through a territorial-national, and therefore racialized, association with a disease.</p>
<p>By way of a summary, this recent history of quarantine measures does not exactly replicate the cordon sanitaire of earlier centuries. The practical importance of virology in the development of the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries means that quarantine zones are not outside circuits of value, even while the quarantine acts as a means of segregation. The contemporary quarantine represents a merger between the authoritarian governance of populations and the facilitation and growth of private, selective health-care infrastructure. Given the importance of nonselectivity and scale to public health, nationalist approaches to health are more accurately described as a way of privatizing public health by other means.</p>

<p><span class="drop">T</span>he surveys continue to conclude that we trust the United States but we don’t trust China. For all the good will most of us feel towards America, it is time we subject this conclusion to further scrutiny.</p>
<p>For sure, the best test of America as a trusted ally was when China invaded Philippine territory&ndash;Scarborough Shoal off the coast of Zambales&ndash;in 2012. Our treaty with the United States says that the US will assist us if we are attacked. And Scarborough Shoal was a downright attack, one which we could not repel. Only the United States could have helped us but it did not.</p>
<p>We have always overestimated our relationship with the United States. The reality is that a small laid back country like ours is just an expendable pawn in the game of international geopolitics, and we are ignored because we are not strong like Japan or South Korea.</p>
<p>American policies towards Asia do not always tally with ours. Mood swings in the United States can also affect its relationship with other countries. At the moment, there seems to be a slow swing towards isolation. This is not because America has lost its dynamism but because it finds that sustaining all its global commitments can be very expensive and can even sap the morale of the party in power and at the same time give strength to the opposition.</p>
<p>American presidents have always been wary of entanglement in a land war in Asia. This must be uppermost in the minds of those policymakers in Washington when they mulled over the problem of a recalcitrant China in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Our South China Sea problem with China has an ominous collateral at home. Realize that 80 percent of the Philippine economy is now in the hands of ethnic Chinese. They came to the Philippines with nothing, and became wealthy through exploitation of the land and the people. The priority, therefore, is for us now to see to it that the economic power of these ethnic Chinese, whose loyalty to the Philippines is in doubt, should be emasculated. The silence of our Filipino Chinese on this crucial issue is deafening. Vietnam is a very good model.</p>
<p>Vietnam has not hesitated to fight the Chinese frontally and yet maintains a close relationship with China. Its economy had been dominated by ethnic Chinese. Cholon, then Saigon’s busiest district, was actually a Chinese enclave. After the triumph of the Revolution in 1975, Vietnam applied a simple solution to its China problem. The Chinese were simply expelled and their properties were confiscated. Several Chinese establishments were set up through the following years, but during the riots some three years ago, when China set up an oil rig in Vietnamese waters, to which the Vietnamese objected furiously, the Chinese factories in Vietnam were burned.</p>
<p>The United States has billions of dollars in mothballed war material, and has excuses for why it is niggardly in its military aid to the Philippines, compared with its assistance to other governments. We must be prepared to increase our military capability on our own, to sacrifice for it even. One of our first priorities is to build a navy with fast frigates to patrol and defend our country. We already have shipbuilding facilities to do this.</p>
<p>We should have three military academies, the military academy in Baguio, perhaps a naval academy in Cebu, and an air force academy in Davao. The first two years of military study will be spent in Baguio. And in the following four years, army officers will continue in Baguio, while naval officers will be in Davao, and air force officers in Cebu.</p>
<p>The ROTC should also be revived. It will be a two-year course, after which anyone aspiring for a military career is qualified to take exams for the military academy. The last six months of the course should be spent with the army units. We will then have ready reserve forces whenever the country needs them. We can gain some lessons from Singapore and Israel.</p>
<p>We also should strengthen our ties with our ASEAN neighbors, and also see to it that these ties have military significance. We must always remember that a strong and united ASEAN is our best defense against any imperial design to colonize Southeast Asia. It is important that ASEAN should form a pillar not only in trade and cultural relations but also in our military ties with neighbor countries.</p>
<p>Our diminished relationship with the United States may be replaced with alliances with other nations – Australia, Japan, South Korea. Because of its consensus decision making process, ASEAN may not be a military deterrent to China’s land grabbing. On the other hand, we can forge alliances with Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>The Defense Secretary has asked for a review of our defense treaties with the United States. All military aid from other countries should also be reviewed.</p>
<p>An American author described us in the 1930s as “the Orphans of the Pacific.” Perhaps that definition fits us now for, in a sense, to be truly free, we must reject our colonial past and struggle not only to survive but to preserve our hard-won. Orphans know they are alone so they strive hard to prevail.</p>
<p>To alter our barnacled attitudes towards the United States means that we will have to be less dependent on the United States for aid; we will also diminish the teacher-pupil relationship. In reviewing our alliances with America, it must be noted that Japan, Korea, and Taiwan took advantage of the American umbrella and market to develop economically and militarily. We did not.</p>
<p>I remember Joseph Lelyveld, former managing editor of The New York Times. He said it is very difficult for America to take our leaders seriously because they are silly. Herein lies the problem: if we should no longer trust America, with our kind of leaders, can we trust ourselves?</p>
