<p>Flaunting an inconsistent mouthpiece of Malacañang Palace, Harry Roque seems to have really adapted the absurd habit of his master: slipping his tongue and taking it back after a while as he said that the Philippines has been on a prolonged vacation due to the coronavirus pandemic. For that, the government then found a way to revoke this so-called ‘vacation’ and to reopen our lost economy –reclassify three holidays as special working holidays, which is totally unsympathetic to every Filipino laborer.</p>
<p>So the truth reveals, the administration only sees this whole pandemic, the series of imposed community quarantines, the loss of jobs of over a million workers, the deaths of numerous businesses, the sufferings of each household figuring how they could eat their next meals and such, as a mere vacation! It must be the reason why they do not do their services with due diligence rather than just ‘gross incompetence’ (as Senator Sotto described), to render for the Filipino people. Yet, our laborers never rested nor even have their peace of mind; they have lost their opportunities to earn a living.</p>
<p>This conflict in labor and employment has undoubtedly struck the Philippine economy. And now that the state of work and service are slowly going back, although still far from normal, Duterte, under Proclamation 1107 amended the list of holidays and special days for 2021 declaring November 2, December 24 and 31 as special working holidays to encourage economic productivity and minimize work disruption to recover from the adverse impact of the pandemic. As if the continuity of work is the issue, these special working holidays will just be ordinary working days but with commemoration –meaning they will no longer have an additional pay equal to the 30% of their daily basic wage.</p>
<p>Coming from positions of power, influence, and wealth, this is a huge insult to Filipino workers doing more than they should to provide for their families and keep themselves surviving during this pandemic that the current government is monumentally failing to address properly. They force Filipinos to perceive the struggle we face as a battle between economy and health when so many other countries in the world have managed to balance both aspects by implementing scientific solutions provided by the right and competent people.</p>
<p>This reflects how Duterte and his government managed the pandemic overall: through surface-level interventions that does not help the country in the long term, provide more suffering to ordinary workers, and to boast as if this is a solution that will benefit the country. Reasoning that it can stimulate the economy if work proceeds as usual during holidays, they seemed to have forgotten that an economy cannot fully function if the citizens and the workers have no money to spend. So, unsurprisingly, this move seems to favor the rich businessmen and employers who have more than enough to make it through this pandemic and even extravagantly celebrate the holidays while workers toil their duties, act as if it was a normal day, and to return home with improper compensation.</p>
<p>Not only the compensation is the case but also the chance of our workers to return from their home provinces during long holidays, as reasoned by Leni Robredo in her radio show. They barely have enough rest as they get a hold of their overwhelming workloads and the new normal set-up in workplaces, and celebrating those special occasions together with the family is what some workers are used to earning their relaxation. Taking it from them, does the government think of nothing? Aren’t they the ones who were unproductive in finding measures?</p>
<p>These holidays are also beneficial for overall mental health and peace of minds of Filipinos. In an environment as stressful as virtual work or physical work with extra rules imposed, breaks are badly needed. In fact, breaks and work pauses are proven to be helpful in increasing productivity and a healthy working mind. Why should the government limit this from a worker? It is pointless and abusive towards the people who choose to spend their holidays with their families and with themselves.</p>
<p>While countries like the United States, British Columbia, France, Virginia and others are raising their efforts for achieving a hundred percent mass vaccination, Duterte unbelievably had this insane proclamation signifying how much of a bully his administration is. It is their desperate act of not being able to think of a decent solution that the workers who have endured long enough are those who they insensitively let to torment more.</p>
<p>This is evident with how much Roque blames the public for the increase in COVID-19 cases because of not following the minimum public health protocols while also encouraging everyone to go out and spend and jumpstart the economy. Excusing their constant inconsistency, they are becoming hypocrites who will not, under any circumstances, admit their wrongs in implementing much more relevant rules that can actually help the country. While the public may not be 100% innocent in this case, it is still the government, who constantly changes the rules, increasingly loosening health policies, and then blames the public for surges in cases.</p>
<p>Now that they pretend to care about public health again because of the rise in cases, it is workers again who must suffer. For months, last year, they failed to implement a viable solution of balancing public health and preventing economic collapse despite their constant reassurances that the best and brightest in the government are working to find a solution. Now the burden falls again on workers to try to adjust and think of ways on how to survive.</p>
<p>Filipino workers have been greatly affected by this global health crisis. The reduction of special non-working holidays are not just a loss of their ‘supposedly additional pay’, but also of their actual rest with their families. The government boasts of their excellence in handling the pandemic yet they constantly fail to help those affected and their self-proclaimed achievements are yet to be felt by the citizens. If they have nothing to offer in boosting the economy apart from this, then they, who the incompetent and unproductive ones are, must resign and take a vacation away from national affairs that they cannot do right.</p>
