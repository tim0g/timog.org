<p><span class="drop">A</span>nti-Terror Law oral arguments continue as Days 7 and 8 were held simultaneously on May 11 and 12 via Zoom, with Solicitor General Jose Calida still avoiding interpellations and letting his assistants trip over questions regarding ATL’s vague standards.</p>
<p>The on-going debate began on February 2 after several delays from Calida. This focuses on the purpose of the Anti-Terror law, its unconstitutionality and its possible dangers for the masses.</p>
<p>There are a total of 37 petitions filed against the said law that were authored by framers of the 1987 Constitution, human rights advocates, lawyers groups, members of the academe, religious organizations, and individuals who have been a victim of red-tagging.</p>
<h3 id="osg-insists-that-there-are-no-vague-provisions-in-atl">OSG insists that there are no vague provisions in ATL</h3>
<p>On May 11, the seventh day of ATL’s oral arguments, the Supreme Court justices raised concerns on the vague provisions of the draconian law, and the possible dangers of the law on red-tagged groups and individuals.</p>
<p>Associate Justice Rodil Zalameda asked why the authors of the ATL did not use a “modifier” on the phrase “provoke the government” when the law defined what will acts of terrorism account for.</p>
<p>However, Assistant Solicitor General (ASG) Raymund Rigodon disagreed that the definition of acts of terrorism is vague.</p>
<p>The definition of terrorism under the Human Security Act used to specify “predicate crimes” such as piracy, rebellion or insurrection, coup d’etat, murder, kidnapping, arson, hijacking, highway robbery, illegal possession and manufacture of firearms and explosives, and violations of the laws regulating toxic substances and nuclear wastes and atomic energy.</p>
<p>This was replaced by some criteria that petitioners deemed unclear, such as acts intended to cause death or injury, damage to property, or using weapons or dangerous substances to “intimidate the general public or a segment thereof, create an atmosphere or spread a message of fear, to provoke or influence by intimidation the government or any international organization, or seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic, or social structures of the country, or create a public emergency or seriously undermine public safety.”</p>
<p>With other provisions that punish speech and actions that may be interpreted as supportive of terrorism, the petitioners themselves, human rights advocates and progressive groups pointed out the law might include the traditionally protected form of expression against government’s shortcomings.</p>
<p>“It is not merely provocation. What I fear about is the phrase ‘provoke the government’ is too vague so as to include any kind of provocation. It did not say that to provoke a government to do or to abstain from doing an act. Just it stated that to provoke the government,” said Zalameda.</p>
<p>When asked by Associate Justice Benjamin Caguioa about who will determine the standard of “creating an atmosphere of fear” Rigodon answered the arresting agents. This was after Rigodon failed to answer the former’s question about his understanding of “atmosphere of fear”.</p>
<p>The state forces have the judicial power, for instance in a physical protest, to declare whether the event is indeed “creating an atmosphere of fear”, requiring activists to prove that they do not intend to cause harm.</p>
<p>“Remember that you are depriving that person a fundamental liberty, a fundamental right to be free, and are you saying that can be done even if there is no standard, or even if that standard is susceptible to different interpretations, as many policemen as there are?” Caguioa said.</p>
<h3 id="done-process-over-due-process">Done process over due process</h3>
<p>Red tagging an individual, group, organization, or institution mirrors the idea of putting a guilty verdict on them even without substantial proof, which is contrary to the principle of presumption of innocence under 1987 Constitution, Bill of Rights Section 14.</p>
<p>It can be remembered that in July 2020, Duterte, during one of his televised pre-recorded speeches, assured the Filipinos they should not be afraid of the ATL if they are not guilty of being a terrorist.</p>
<p>“For the law-abiding citizen of this country, I am addressing you with all sincerity, do not be afraid if you are not a terrorist.”</p>
<p>On the 7th day of ATL oral argument, Rigodon reiterated this. However, this promise has already been used before during the drug war but the campaign still took more than 20,000 lives, targeting mostly poor communities, putting suspects on ‘drug lists’ compiled by local community leaders.</p>
<p>While Sen. Bato Dela Rosa claims that policemen did not want to harm innocent civilians but “shit happens” in an “imperfect world”, the Duterte regime has created a culture of impunity.</p>
<p>The innocent lives taken were downgraded into collateral damage, justice is hardly served when the Philippine National Police (PNP) themselves are uncooperative in investigations.</p>
<p>Even after the promises during the height of his state-sponsored killings, innocent lives were still taken without accountability from the state forces who executed almost instantaneously. Duterte’s empty rhetoric about ‘not being afraid of ATL’ does not guarantee the safety of the public, especially if the draconian law follows ‘done process’ than ‘due process’.</p>
<p>“Is that enough? Is that enough to allay the fears, the suspicions, the apprehensions, the repugnance of the public? Is lip service enough?” Associate Justice Amy Lazaro-Javier asked Rigodon during the oral argument in relation to their assertion that there is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Rigodon answered her through reading the law’s regulation policy but he was cut off as Javier rested the case and said, “Please pardon me, but I think the answer is not responsive to my question. So please, I have no time to debate with you on this, so please present this in your memorandum.”</p>
<h3 id="on-the-relentless-red-tagging-of-ntf-elcac-frontmen">On the relentless red-tagging of NTF-ELCAC frontmen</h3>
<p>Still on the seventh day of the oral arguments, government lawyers were pressed regarding the relentless red-tagging of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC).</p>
<p>Associate Justice Javier cited red-tagged partylist groups Gabriela Women’s Party and Kabataan, even when they have never been mentioned in any official resolutions and proclamations as fronts of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People’s Army (CPP-NPA).</p>
<p>“Does this mean that after all these months of tagging Kabataan and Gabriela as fronts of the CPP and NPA, there is insufficient evidence linking them to said terrorist organizations after all?” she asked.</p>
<p>ASG Marissa dela Cruz-Galandines did not answer and instead deferred to National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr., who was supposed to present himself on the next day of the oral arguments.</p>
<p>Since the law was passed, activists and journalists have reportedly been labeled “communists,” and “terrorists,” have been threatened, jailed on trumped up charges with planted evidence, tortured, and killed during the execution of “search warrants”.</p>
<p>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) has argued that NTF-ELCAC spokesperson Lieutenant General Antonio Parlade Jr’s red-tagging on his social media accounts is done in his personal accounts.</p>
<p>Javier asked if ever the government had disavowed his statements. They did not. The Department of Justice (DOJ) secretary Menardo Guevarra, who is also among the 20 members of the NTF-ELCAC, even deferred to his undersecretary when he was asked whether he stands by the public claims of Parlade and Press Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy regarding the ‘communist links’ of the community pantries.</p>
<p>It can be remembered that during Day 6, Galandines told the Supreme Court that red-tagging was a term coined by leftists, and that what the government did was “truth-tagging.”</p>
<p>According to Rappler’s fact-checking report, the terms “red-tagging,” “red tag” or “red-tagged” were already used in writings that involve communism even before Jose Maria Sison founded the CPP in 1968.</p>
<p>Galandines claimed that “truth-tagging” involves a “comprehensive, detailed and careful evaluation of circumstances before the government comes up with the tagging of a person or organization.”</p>
<p>NTF-ELCAC did not present any evidence to support their claims that the progressive groups, human rights defenders, activists and union leaders they tagged were indeed part of CPP-NPA.</p>
<h3 id="the-anti-terrorism-councils-unconstitutionality">The Anti-Terrorism Council’s unconstitutionality</h3>
<p>In ATL’s provision, ATC, currently headed by Executive Secretary, have the authority to designate individuals and organizations as terrorists without any hearing, as long as it deems that there is a ‘probable cause’ that they commit any acts defined as terrorism under the Sections 4 to 12. ATC would not have to obtain warrants from the courts to do this.</p>
<p>Petitioners stressed that the authority vested in ATC violates the Supreme Court’s rule-making power.</p>
<p>A day after the Day 8 of the oral arguments, the Anti-Terrorism Council released a resolution formally tagging 19 people as terrorists, which include CPP founder Jose Maria Sison and his wife Julieta Sison, National Democratic Front of the Philippines peace consultants Benito Tiamzon, Wilma Tiamzon, Rafael Baylosis, Vicente Ladlad and other alleged members of the CPP.</p>
<p>The resolution claims that the 19 listed violated Sections 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.</p>
<p>“Based on verified and validated information, the ATC found probable cause, as defined in the Anti-Terrorism Act, warranting the designation of the following central committee members of the CPP… for planning, preparing, facilitating, conspiring, and inciting the commission of terrorism and recruitment to and membership in a terrorist organization or a group organized for the purpose of engaging in terrorism,” the resolution read.</p>
<p>On Section 27, courts are permitted to declare preliminary groups as terrorists even without a full hearing. If it finds probable cause and finds the petition sufficient in form and substance, it can issue within 72 hours a preliminary order of proscription, meaning people can be declared as terrorists right away.</p>
<p>The passage allows the council to label a person a terrorist, without requiring said person the opportunity to present contrary evidence. This is contrary to the Bill of Rights Article III, Sec. 14, which states that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt; and Section 18, which states that no person shall be detained solely by reason of his political beliefs and aspirations and no involuntary servitude in any form shall exist except as a punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-misconception-with-communisms-legality">On the misconception with communism’s legality</h3>
<p>Associate Justice Marvic Leonen, on the other hand, pointed out that terrorism goes beyond communist terrorism and communism is not a crime in itself.</p>
<p>Leonen said to be a communist is not wrong because to be a communist simply “means you believe in the writings of Karl Marx and the communist manifesto.”</p>
<p>In 1992, then-President Fidel V. Ramos already repealed the Anti- Subversion Law, a law that made being a member of the CPP illegal.</p>
<p>“Are we going after those that we deem leftist simply because we feel them as leftist? And contrary to the opinion of others, being leftist is again pejorative, because it reflects on whoever is labeling that person. What if I told you I’m socialist? Am I leftist? What if I told you that in the heart of my hearts, I believe that the ownership of means of production should be in the hands of workers, am I communist?” Leonen asked.</p>
<p>Yet again, the government lawyers could only put a loose end answer with Galandines saying that ideologies should never be punished.</p>
<h3 id="senator-drilon-files-bill-to-criminalize-red-tagging">Senator Drilon files bill to criminalize red-tagging</h3>
<p>On March 24, Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon filed Senate Bill No. 2121, an Act Defining and Penalizing the Crime of Red-tagging. The Bill seeks to punish red-tagging state agents with up to ten years in prison and disqualification from public office.</p>
<p>In the said bill, red-tagging was defined as the “act of labeling, vilifying, branding, naming, accusing, harassing, persecuting, stereotyping, or caricaturing individuals, groups, or organizations as state enemies, left-leaning, subversives, communists, or terrorists as part of a counter-insurgency or anti-terrorism strategy or program, by any state actor, such as law enforcement agent, paramilitary, or military personnel.”</p>
<p>“The passage of this bill will reverse the ‘increasingly institutionalization and normalization of human rights violations’ and put a stop on the attacks against the members of the legal profession,” Drilon said in the bill’s explanatory note.</p>
<p>Anyone found guilty will face up to 10 years jail time and disqualification of persons convicted from holding public office.</p>
<p>It can be remembered that in February, the senate panel insisted that there is no need to criminalize red-tagging in the Philippines since there are already legal remedies available to an aggrieved party. But after the Senate employees’ unions were accused of having communist links, Senate President Vicente Sotto III expressed his support for the bill against red-tagging.</p>
<p>“Victims are left without proper recourse against their perpetrators and are forced to file seemingly-appropriate-but-not-quite-cases, like libel and grave threats,” Drilon said.</p>
<p>For petitioners and supporters of junking ATL, libel cases, writ of habeas data and writ of amparo are not enough for the protection of the victims because they do not get the right and adequate justice. Red-tagging has already killed several people and therefore protection and justice for the victims must be served.</p>
<p>Activism and communism are not crimes, as the Anti-Subversion Law was repealed in 1992. In the culture of impunity Duterte has created, attacks and trumped up charges against human rights defenders, journalists, activists and the masses continue to prevail. The red-tagging spree of state forces mouthpieces against the critics of the government is a clear violation of the Section 4 of the Bill of Rights. Anti-Terror Law only grants the regime excessive and unchecked powers that further jeopardise democracy.</p>
