This page tells you how to use the theme to add and structure your site content.\nContent root directory You add content for your site under the content root directory of your Hugo site project - either content/ or a language-specific root like content/en/. The main exception here is static files that you don’t want built into your site: you can find out more about where you add these below in Adding static content. The files in your content root directory are typically grouped in subdirectories corresponding to your site’s sections and templates, which we’ll look at in Content sections and templates.\nYou can find out more about Hugo directory structure in Directory Structure Explained.\nContent sections and templates Hugo builds your site pages using the content files you provide plus any templates provided by your site’s theme. These templates (or “layouts” in Hugo terminology) include things like your page’s headers, footers, navigation, and links to stylesheets: essentially, everything except your page’s specific content. The templates in turn can be made up of partials: little reusable snippets of HTML for page elements like headers, search boxes, and more.\nBecause most technical documentation sites have different sections for different types of content, the Docsy theme comes with the following templates for top-level site sections that you might need:\n docs is for pages in your site’s Documentation section. blog is for pages in your site’s Blog. community is for your site’s Community page.  It also provides a default “landing page” type of template with the site header and footer, but no left nav, that you can use for any other section. In this site and our example site it’s used for the site home page and the About page.\nEach top-level section in your site corresponds to a directory in your site content root. Hugo automatically applies the appropriate template for that section, depending on which folder the content is in. For example, this page is in the docs subdirectory of the site’s content root directory content/en/, so Hugo automatically applies the docs template. You can override this by explicitly specifying a template or content type for a particular page.\nIf you’ve copied the example site, you already have appropriately named top-level section directories for using Docsy’s templates, each with an index page ( _index.md or index.html) page for users to land on. These top-level sections also appear in the example site’s top-level menu.\nCustom sections If you’ve copied the example site and don’t want to use one of the provided content sections, just delete the appropriate content subdirectory. Similarly, if you want to add a top-level section, just add a new subdirectory, though you’ll need to specify the layout or content type explicitly in the frontmatter of each page if you want to use any existing Docsy template other than the default one. For example, if you create a new directory content/en/amazing and want one or more pages in that custom section to use Docsy’s docs template, you add type: docs to the frontmatter of each page:\n---title:\"My amazing new section\"weight:1type:docsdescription:\u003eA special section with a docs layout.---Alternatively, create your own page template for your new section in your project’s layouts directory based on one of the existing templates.\nYou can find out much more about how Hugo page layouts work in Hugo Templates. The rest of this page tells you about how to add content and use each of Docsy’s templates.\nAlternative site structure As noted above, by default your site has a home page (using the _default layout), a docs section under /docs/, a blog section under /blog/ and a community section under /community/. The type of each section (which determines the layout it uses) matches its directory name.\nIn some cases, you may want to have a different directory structure, but still make use of Docsy’s layouts. A common example is for a “docs site”, where most of the pages (including the home page) use the docs layout, or perhaps you’d rather have a /news/ directory treated with the blog layout.\nSince Hugo 0.76, this has become practical without copying layouts to your site, or having to specify type: blog on every single page by making use of target specific cascading front matter.\nFor example, for the /news/ section, you can specify the following front matter in the index page which will change the type of the section and everything below it to “blog”:\n---title:\"Latest News\"linkTitle:\"News\"menu:main:weight:30cascade:- type:\"blog\"---If you want to create a “docs” site, specifying something like the following in the top level _index.md will set all top level sections to be treated as “docs”, except for “news”:\n---title:\"My Wonderful Site\"cascade:- type:\"blog\"toc_root:true_target:path:\"/news/**\"- type:\"docs\"_target:path:\"/**\"---Note the addition of toc_root here. Setting that to true for a section causes it to be treated as a separate part of the site, with its own left hand navigation menu.\nAn example docs-based site that uses this technique can be found at the mostly docs repo.\nPage frontmatter Each page file in a Hugo site has metadata frontmatter that tells Hugo about the page. You specify page frontmatter in TOML, YAML, or JSON (our example site and this site use YAML). Use the frontmatter to specify the page title, description, creation date, link title, template, menu weighting, and even any resources such as images used by the page. You can see a complete list of possible page frontmatter in Front Matter.\nFor example, here’s the frontmatter for this page:\n---title:\"Adding Content\"linkTitle:\"Adding Content\"weight:1description:\u003eAdd different types of content to your Docsy site.---The minimum frontmatter you need to provide is a title: everything else is up to you! (though if you leave out the page weight your navigation may get a little disorganized).\nPage contents and markup By default you create pages in a Docsy site as simple Markdown or HTML files with page frontmatter, as described above. Versions of Hugo before 0.60 use BlackFriday as its Markdown parser. From 0.60, Hugo uses Goldmark as its Markdown parser by default.\nTip If you’ve been using earlier versions of Hugo, you may need to make some small changes to your site to work with the current Markdown parser. In particular, if you cloned an earlier version of our example site, add the following to your config.toml to allow Goldmark to render raw HTML as well as Markdown:\n[markup] [markup.goldmark] [markup.goldmark.renderer] unsafe = true Alternatively, if you want to continue using Blackfriday, you can follow the instructions in the Hugo documentation to change the Markdown parser.\n In addition to your marked-up text, you can also use Hugo and Docsy’s shortcodes: reusable chunks of HTML that you can use to quickly build your pages. Find out more about shortcodes in Docsy Shortcodes.\nNote Hugo also supports adding content using other markups using external parsers as helpers. For example, you can add content in RST using rst2html as an external parser (though be aware this does not support all flavors of RST, such as Sphinx RST). Similarly, you can use asciidoctor to parse Asciidoc files, or pandoc for other formats.\nExternal parsers may not be suitable for use with all deployment options, as you’ll need to install the external parser and run Hugo yourself to generate your site (so, for example, you won’t be able to use Netlify’s continuous deployment feature). In addition, adding an external parser may cause performance issues building larger sites.\n Working with links Hugo lets you specify links using normal Markdown syntax, though remember that you need to specify links relative to your site’s root URL, and that relative URLs are left unchanged by Hugo in your site’s generated HTML.\nAlternatively you can use Hugo’s helper ref and relref shortcodes for creating internal links that resolve to the correct URL. However, be aware this means your links will not appear as links at all if a user views your page outside your generated site, for example using the rendered Markdown feature in GitHub’s web UI.\nYou can find (or add!) tips and gotchas for working with Hugo links in Hugo Tips.\nContent style We don’t mandate any particular style for your page contents. However, if you’d like some guidance on how to write and format clear, concise technical documentation, we recommend the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide, particularly the Style Guide Highlights.\nPage bundles You can create site pages as standalone files in their section or subsection directory, or as folders where the content is in the folder’s index page. Creating a folder for your page lets you bundle images and other resources together with the content.\nYou can see examples of both approaches in this and our example site. For example, the source for this page is just a standalone file /content/en/docs/adding-content.md. However the source for Docsy Shortcodes in this site lives in /content/en/docs/adding-content/shortcodes/index.md, with the image resource used by the page in the same /shortcodes/ directory. In Hugo terminology, this is called a leaf bundle because it’s a folder containing all the data for a single site page without any child pages (and uses index.md without an underscore).\nYou can find out much more about managing resources with Hugo bundles in Page Bundles.\nAdding docs and blog posts The template you’ll probably use most often is the docs template (as used in this page) or the very similar blog template. Both these templates include:\n a left nav GitHub links (populated from your site config) for readers to edit the page or create issues a page menu  as well as the common header and footer used by all your site’s pages. Which template is applied depends on whether you’ve added the content to the blog or docs content directory. You can find out more about how the nav and page menu are created in Navigation and Search.\nOrganizing your documentation While Docsy’s top-level sections let you create site sections for different types of content, you may also want to organize your docs content within your docs section. For example, this site’s docs section directory has multiple subdirectories for Getting Started, Content and Customization, and so on. Each subdirectory has an _index.md (it could also be an _index.html), which acts as a section index page and tells Hugo that the relevant directory is a subsection of your docs.\nDocsy’s docs layout gives you a left nav pane with an autogenerated nested menu based on your docs file structure. Each standalone page or subsection _index.md or _index.html page in the docs/ directory gets a top level menu item, using the link name and weight metadata from the page or index.\nTo add docs to a subsection, just add your page files to the relevant subdirectory. Any pages that you add to a subsection in addition to the subsection index page will appear in a submenu (look to the left to see one in action!), again ordered by page weight. Find out more about adding Docsy’s navigation metadata in Navigation and Search\nIf you’ve copied the example site, you’ll already have some suggested subdirectories in your docs directory, with guidance for what types of content to put in them and some example Markdown pages. You can find out more about organizing your content with Docsy in Organizing Your Content.\nDocs section landing pages By default a docs section landing page (the _index.md or _index.html in the section directory) uses a layout that adds a formatted list of links to the pages in the section, with their frontmatter descriptions. The Content and Customization landing page in this site is a good example.\nTo display a simple bulleted list of links to the section’s pages instead, specify simple_list: true in the landing page’s frontmatter:\n--- title: \"Simple List Page\" simple_list: true weight: 20 --- To display no links at all, specify no_list: true in the landing page’s frontmatter:\n--- title: \"No List Page\" no_list: true weight: 20 --- Organizing your blog posts Docsy’s blog layout also gives you a left nav menu (like the docs layout), and a list-type index page for your blog that’s applied to /blog/_index.md and automatically displays snippets of all your recent posts in reverse chronological order.\nTo create different blog categories to organize your posts, create subfolders in blog/. For instance, in our example site we have news and releases. Each category needs to have its own _index.md or _index.html landing page file specifying the category title for it to appear properly in the left nav and top-level blog landing page. Here’s the index page for releases:\n--- title: \"New Releases\" linkTitle: \"Releases\" weight: 20 --- To add author and date information to blog posts, add them to the page frontmatter:\n--- date: 2018-10-06 title: \"Easy documentation with Docsy\" linkTitle: \"Announcing Docsy\" description: \"The Docsy Hugo theme lets project maintainers and contributors focus on content, not on reinventing a website infrastructure from scratch\" author: Riona MacNamara resources: - src: \"**.{png,jpg}\" title: \"Image #:counter\" params: byline: \"Photo: Riona MacNamara / CC-BY-CA\" --- If you’ve copied the example site and you don’t want a blog section, or want to link to an external blog instead, just delete the blog subdirectory.\nWorking with top-level landing pages. Docsy’s default page template has no left nav and is useful for creating a home page for your site or other “landing” type pages.\nCustomizing the example site pages If you’ve copied the example site, you already have a simple site landing page in content/en/_index.html. This is made up of Docsy’s provided Hugo shortcode page blocks.\nTo customize the large landing image, which is in a cover block, replace the content/en/featured-background.jpg file in your project with your own image (it can be called whatever you like as long as it has background in the file name). You can remove or add as many blocks as you like, as well as adding your own custom content.\nThe example site also has an About page in content/en/about/_index.html using the same Docsy template. Again, this is made up of page blocks, including another background image in content/en/about/featured-background.jpg. As with the site landing page, you can replace the image, remove or add blocks, or just add your own content.\nBuilding your own landing pages If you’ve just used the theme, you can still use all Docsy’s provided page blocks (or any other content you want) to build your own landing pages in the same file locations.\nAdding a community page The community landing page template has boilerplate content that’s automatically filled in with the project name and community links specified in config.toml, providing your users with quick links to resources that help them get involved in your project. The same links are also added by default to your site footer.\n[params.links] # End user relevant links. These will show up on left side of footer and in the community page if you have one. [[params.links.user]] name = \"User mailing list\" url = \"https://example.org/mail\" icon = \"fa fa-envelope\" desc = \"Discussion and help from your fellow users\" [[params.links.user]] name =\"Twitter\" url = \"https://example.org/twitter\" icon = \"fab fa-twitter\" desc = \"Follow us on Twitter to get the latest news!\" [[params.links.user]] name = \"Stack Overflow\" url = \"https://example.org/stack\" icon = \"fab fa-stack-overflow\" desc = \"Practical questions and curated answers\" # Developer relevant links. These will show up on right side of footer and in the community page if you have one. [[params.links.developer]] name = \"GitHub\" url = \"https://github.com/google/docsy\" icon = \"fab fa-github\" desc = \"Development takes place here!\" [[params.links.developer]] name = \"Slack\" url = \"https://example.org/slack\" icon = \"fab fa-slack\" desc = \"Chat with other project developers\" [[params.links.developer]] name = \"Developer mailing list\" url = \"https://example.org/mail\" icon = \"fa fa-envelope\" desc = \"Discuss development issues around the project\" If you’re creating your own site and want to add a page using this template, add a /community/_index.md file in your content root directory. If you’ve copied the example site and don’t want a community page, just delete the /content/en/community/ directory in your project repo.\nAdding static content You may want to serve some non-Hugo-built content along with your site: for example, if you have generated reference docs using Doxygen, Javadoc, or other doc generation tools.\nTo add static content to be served “as-is”, just add the content as a folder and/or files in your site’s static directory. When your site is deployed, content in this directory is served at the site root path. So, for example, if you have added content at /static/reference/cpp/, users can access that content at http://{server-url}/reference/cpp/ and you can link to pages in this directory from other pages at /reference/cpp/{file name}.\nYou can also use this directory for other files used by your project, including image files. You can find out more about serving static files, including configuring multiple directories for static content, in Static Files.\nRSS feeds Hugo will, by default, create an RSS feed for the home page and any section. For the main RSS feed you can control which sections to include by setting a site param in your config.toml. This is the default configuration:\nrss_sections = [\"blog\"] To disable all RSS feeds, add the following to your config.toml:\ndisableKinds = [\"RSS\"] Sitemap Hugo creates a sitemap.xml file for your generated site by default: for example, here’s the sitemap for this site.\nYou can configure the frequency with which your sitemap is updated, your sitemap filename, and the default page priority in your config.toml:\n[sitemap] changefreq = \"monthly\" filename = \"sitemap.xml\" priority = 0.5 To override any of these values for a given page, specify it in page frontmatter:\n---title:\"Adding Content\"linkTitle:\"Adding Content\"weight:1description:\u003eAdd different types of content to your Docsy site.sitemap:priority:1.0---To learn more about configuring sitemaps, see Sitemap Template.\n","categories":"","description":"Add different types of content to your Docsy site.\n","excerpt":"Add different types of content to your Docsy site.\n","ref":"/guide/appendix/content/","tags":"","title":"Adding Content"},{"body":"\r\r\rAddress\r2627, 1300 Rxas Blvd, Pasay, Metro Manila, Philippines\r\r\rOffice Hours\r9:00 to 18:00 Monday to Friday\r\r\rTelephone\r(+63) 2 551-5710\r\r\rFax\r(+63) 2 551-5780\r\r\r\r Official website of the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines  Google Map ","categories":"","description":"Visa application and other consular services\n","excerpt":"Visa application and other consular services\n","ref":"/guide/visa-application/japan-embassy-manila-philippines/","tags":"","title":"Embassy of Japan in the Philippines"},{"body":"Para sa first-time application (bagong panganak na bata) o renewal ng passport na malapit nang mawalan nang bisa.\nAng appointment para sa application ng passport ay kailangang gawin sa Online ePassport Application page ng Embassy:\nAno ang kailangan  Computer na may internet access.

However, if you want your own color scheme (and you probably will!) you can very easily override the theme defaults with your own project-specific values - Hugo will look in your project files first when looking for information to build your site. Also because Docsy uses Bootstrap 4 and SCSS for styling, you can override just single values in its special SCSS project variables file, or do more serious customization by creating your own versions of entire SCSS files.\nColor palette and other styles To quickly change your site’s colors, add SCSS variable project overrides to assets/scss/_variables_project.scss. A simple example changing the primary and secondary color to two shades of purple:\n$primary: #390040; $secondary: #A23B72;  See assets/scss/_variables.scss in the theme for color variables etc. that can be set to change the look and feel. Also see available variables in Bootstrap 4: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/ and https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_variables.scss  The theme has features such as rounded corners and gradient backgrounds enabled by default. These can also be toggled in your project variables file:\n$enable-gradients: true; $enable-rounded: true; $enable-shadows: true;  Tip PostCSS (autoprefixing of CSS browser-prefixes) is not enabled when running in server mode (it is a little slow), so Chrome is the recommended choice for development.  Also note that any SCSS import will try the project before the theme, so you can – as one example – create your own _assets/scss/_content.scss and get full control over how your Markdown content is styled.\nFonts The theme uses Open Sans as its primary font. To disable Google Fonts and use a system font, set this SCSS variable in assets/scss/_variables_project.scss:\n$td-enable-google-fonts: false; To configure another Google Font:\n$google_font_name: \"Open Sans\"; $google_font_family: \"Open+Sans:300,300i,400,400i,700,700i\"; Note that if you decide to go with a font with different weights (in the built-in configuration this is 300 (light), 400 (medium) and 700 (bold)), you also need to adjust the weight related variables, i.e. variables starting with $font-weight-.\nCSS utilities For documentation of available CSS utility classes, see the Bootstrap Documentation. This theme adds very little on its own in this area. However, we have added some color state CSS classes that can be useful in a dynamic context:\n .-bg-\u003ccolor\u003e .-text-\u003ccolor\u003e  You can use these classes, for example, to style your text in an appropriate color when you don’t know if the primary color is dark or light, to ensure proper color contrast. They are also useful when you receive the color code as a shortcode parameter.\nThe value of \u003ccolor\u003e can be any of the color names, primary, white, dark, warning, light, success, 300, blue, orange etc.\nWhen you use .-bg-\u003ccolor\u003e, the text colors will be adjusted to get proper contrast:\n\u003cdiv class=\"-bg-primary p-3 display-4\"\u003eBackground: Primary\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"-bg-200 p-3 display-4\"\u003eBackground: Gray 200\u003c/div\u003e Background: Primary Background: Gray 200 .-text-\u003ccolor\u003e sets the text color only:\n\u003cdiv class=\"-text-blue pt-3 display-4\"\u003eText: Blue\u003c/div\u003e Text: Blue Code highlighting with Chroma With Hugo version 0.60 and higher, you can choose from a range of code block highlight and colour styles using Chroma that are applied to your fenced code blocks by default. If you copied a recent config.toml your site uses Tango (like this site), otherwise the Hugo default is Monokai. You can switch to any of the available Chroma styles (including our Docsy default Tango) using your config.toml:\n[markup] [markup.goldmark] [markup.goldmark.renderer] unsafe = true [markup.highlight] # See a complete list of available styles at https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/all.html style = \"tango\" By default code highlighting styles are not applied to code blocks without a specified language, instead you get Docsy’s default style of grey with black text. If you would like the code highlighting style to apply to all code blocks, even without a language, uncomment or add the following line under [markup.highlight] in your config.toml.\n# Uncomment if you want your chosen highlight style used for code blocks without a specified language guessSyntax = \"true\" You can find out more about code highlighting in Hugo with Chroma in Syntax Highlighting.\nCode highlighting with Prism Optionally, you can enable Prism syntax highlighting in your config.toml:\n# Enable syntax highlighting and copy buttons on code blocks with Prism prism_syntax_highlighting = true When this option is enabled your site uses Prism instead of Chroma for code block highlighting.\nPrism is a popular open source syntax highlighter which supports over 200 languages and various plugins.\nDocsy includes JavaScript and CSS files for a basic Prism configuration, which supports:\n Code blocks styled with the Prism Default theme Copy to clipboard buttons on code blocks Syntax highlighting for a number of common languages, as specified in the following Prism download link:  https://prismjs.com/download.html#themes=prism\u0026languages=markup+css+clike+javascript+bash+c+csharp+cpp+go+java+markdown+python+scss+sql+toml+yaml\u0026plugins=toolbar+copy-to-clipboard Code blocks with no language By default Prism code highlighting styles are not applied to code blocks without a specified language, instead you get Docsy’s default style of grey with black text. To apply Prism styling to code blocks with no language or a language not supported by Prism, specify none as the language after your triple backticks.\nExtending Prism for additional languages or plugins If the included Prism configuration is not sufficient for your requirements, and you want to use additional languages or plugins you can replace the included files with your own.\n Download your own Prism JS and CSS files from https://prismjs.com/download.html Replace the included Prism JS and CSS with the files you downloaded:  Copy the Javascript file to static/js/prism.js Copy the CSS file to static/css/prism.css    \\(\\LaTeX\\) support with \\(\\KaTeX\\) \\(\\LaTeX\\) is a high-quality typesetting system for the production of technical and scientific documentation. Due to its excellent math typesetting capabilities, \\(\\TeX\\) became the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents, especially if these documents contain a lot of mathematical formulae. Designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth, the initial version was released in 1978. Dating back that far, \\(\\LaTeX\\) has pdf as its primary output target and is not particularly well suited for producing HTML output for the Web. Fortunately, with \\(\\KaTeX\\) there exists a fast and easy-to-use JavaScript library for \\(\\TeX\\) math rendering on the web, which was integrated into the Docsy theme.\nWith \\(\\KaTeX\\) support enabled in Docsy, you can include complex mathematical formulae into your web page, either inline or centred on its own line. Since \\(\\KaTeX\\) relies on server side rendering, it produces the same output regardless of your browser or your environment. Formulae can be shown either inline or in display mode:\nInline formulae The following code sample produces a text line with three inline formulae:\nWhen \\\\(a \\ne 0\\\\), there are two solutions to \\\\(ax2 + bx + c= 0\\\\) and they are \\\\(x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}.\\\\) When \\(a \\ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax2 + bx + c= 0\\) and they are \\(x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}.\\)\nFormulae in display mode The following code sample produces an introductory text line followed by a formula numbered as (1) residing on her own line:\nThe probability of getting \\\\(k\\\\) heads when flipping \\\\(n\\\\) coins is: $$\\tag*{(1)} P(E)={n \\choosek} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$ The probability of getting \\(k\\) heads when flipping \\(n\\) coins is: $$\\tag*{(1)} P(E) = {n \\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nTip This wiki page provides in-depth information about typesetting mathematical formulae using the \\(\\LaTeX\\) typesetting system.  Enabling and configuring \\(\\LaTeX\\) support To enable/disable \\(\\KaTeX\\) support inside the Docsy theme, update config.toml:\n[params.katex] enable = true Additionally, you can customize various \\(\\KaTeX\\) options inside config.toml, if needed:\n[params.katex] # enable/disable KaTeX support enable = true # Element(s) scanned by auto render extension. Default: document.body html_dom_element = \"document.body\" [params.katex.options] # If true (the default), KaTeX will throw a ParseError when it encounters an # unsupported command or invalid LaTeX. If false, KaTeX will render unsupported # commands as text, and render invalid LaTeX as its source code with hover text # giving the error, in the color given by errorColor. throwOnError = false errorColor = \"#CD5C5C\" # This is a list of delimiters to look for math, processed in the same order as # the list. Each delimiter has three properties: # left: A string which starts the math expression (i.e. the left delimiter). # right: A string which ends the math expression (i.e. the right delimiter). # display: Whether math in the expression should be rendered in display mode. [[params.katex.options.delimiters]] left = \"$$\" right = \"$$\" display = true [[params.katex.options.delimiters]] left = \"$\" right = \"$\" display = false [[params.katex.options.delimiters]] left = \"\\\\(\" right = \"\\\\)\" display = false [[params.katex.options.delimiters]] left = \"\\\\[\" right = '\\\\]' display = true For a complete list of options and their detailed description, have a look at the documentation of \\({\\KaTeX}’s\\) Rendering API options and of \\({\\KaTeX}’s\\) configuration options.\nDisplay of Chemical Equations and Physical Units mhchem is a \\(\\LaTeX\\) package for typesetting chemical molecular formulae and equations. Fortunately, \\(\\KaTeX\\) provides the mhchem extension that makes the mhchem package accessible when authoring content for the web. Since this extension was integrated into the Docsy theme, you can write beautiful chemical equations easily once mhchem support is enabled inside your config.toml:\n[params.katex] enable = true [params.katex.mhchem] enable = true With mhchem extension enabled, you can easily include chemical equations into your page. The equations can be shown either inline or can reside on its own line. The following code sample produces a text line including a chemical equation:\n*Precipitation of barium sulfate:* \\\\(\\ce{SO4^2- + Ba^2+ -\u003e BaSO4 v}\\\\) Precipitation of barium sulfate: \\(\\ce{SO4^2- + Ba^2+ -\u003e BaSO4 v}\\)\nMore complex equations, like the one shown in the code sample below, should be displayed on their own line:\n$$\\tag*{(2)} \\ce{Zn^2+ \u003c=\u003e[+ 2OH-][+ 2H+] $\\underset{\\text{amphoteric hydroxide}}{\\ce{Zn(OH)2 v}}$ \u003c=\u003e[+ 2OH-][+ 2H+] $\\underset{\\text{tetrahydroxozincate}}{\\ce{[Zn(OH)4]^2-}}$}$$ $$\\tag*{(2)} \\ce{Zn^2+ \u003c=\u003e[+ 2OH-][+ 2H+] $\\underset{\\text{amphoteric hydroxide}}{\\ce{Zn(OH)2 v}}$ \u003c=\u003e[+ 2OH-][+ 2H+] $\\underset{\\text{tetrahydroxozincate}}{\\ce{[Zn(OH)4]^2-}}$}$$\nTip The manual for mchem’s input syntax provides in-depth information about typesetting chemical formulae and physical units using the mhchem tool.  Use of mhchem is not limited to the authoring of chemical equations, using the included \\pu command, pretty looking physical units can be written with ease, too. The following code sample produces two text lines with four numbers plus their corresponding physical units:\n* Scientific number notation: \\\\(\\pu{1.2e3 kJ}\\\\) or \\\\(\\pu{1.2E3 kJ}\\\\) \\\\ * Divisions: \\\\(\\pu{123 kJ/mol}\\\\) or \\\\(\\pu{123 kJ//mol}\\\\)  Scientific number notation: \\(\\pu{1.2e3 kJ}\\) or \\(\\pu{1.2E3 kJ}\\) Divisions: \\(\\pu{123 kJ/mol}\\) or \\(\\pu{123 kJ//mol}\\)  For a complete list of options when authoring physical units, have a look at the section on physical units in the mhchem documentation.\nDiagrams with Mermaid Mermaid is a Javascript library for rendering simple text definitions to useful diagrams in the browser. It can generate a variety of different diagram types, including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, ER diagrams, user journey diagrams, Gantt charts and pie charts.\nWith Mermaid support enabled in Docsy, you can include the text definition of a Mermaid diagram inside a code block, and it will automatically be rendered by the browser as soon as the page loads.\nThe great advantage of this is anyone who can edit the page can now edit the diagram - no more hunting for the original tools and version to make a new edit.\nFor example, the following defines a simple flowchart:\n```mermaid graph LR Start --\u003e Need{\"Do I need diagrams\"} Need -- No --\u003e Off[\"Set params.mermaid.enable = false\"] Need -- Yes --\u003e HaveFun[\"Great! Enjoy!\"] ``` Automatically renders to:\ngraph LR Start --\u003e Need{\"Do I need diagrams\"} Need -- No --\u003e Off[\"Set params.mermaid.enable = false\"] Need -- Yes --\u003e HaveFun[\"Great! Enjoy!\"] To enable/disable Mermaid, update config.toml:\n[params.mermaid] enable = true You can also update settings for Mermaid, such as themes, padding, etc:\n[params.mermaid] enable = true theme = \"neutral\" [params.mermaid.flowchart] diagramPadding = 6 See the Mermaid documentation for a list of defaults that can be overridden.\nSettings can also be overridden on a per-diagram basis by making use of the %%init%% header at the start of the diagram definition. See the Mermaid theming documentation.\nUML Diagrams with PlantUML PlantUML is an alternative to Mermaid that lets you quickly create UML diagrams, including sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, and state diagrams. Unlike Mermaid diagrams, which are entirely rendered in the browser, PlantUML uses a PlantUML server to create diagrams. You can use the provided default demo server (not recommended for production use), or run a server yourself. PlantUML offers a wider range of image types than Mermaid, so may be a better choice for some use cases.\nDiagrams are defined using a simple and intuitive language. (see PlantUML Language Reference Guide).\nThe following example shows a use case diagram:\n```plantuml participant participant as Foo actor actor as Foo1 boundary boundary as Foo2 control control as Foo3 entity entity as Foo4 database database as Foo5 collections collections as Foo6 queue queue as Foo7 Foo -\u003e Foo1 : To actor Foo -\u003e Foo2 : To boundary Foo -\u003e Foo3 : To control Foo -\u003e Foo4 : To entity Foo -\u003e Foo5 : To database Foo -\u003e Foo6 : To collections Foo -\u003e Foo7: To queue ``` Automatically renders to:\nparticipant participant as Foo actor actor as Foo1 boundary boundary as Foo2 control control as Foo3 entity entity as Foo4 database database as Foo5 collections collections as Foo6 queue queue as Foo7 Foo -\u003e Foo1 : To actor Foo -\u003e Foo2 : To boundary Foo -\u003e Foo3 : To control Foo -\u003e Foo4 : To entity Foo -\u003e Foo5 : To database Foo -\u003e Foo6 : To collections Foo -\u003e Foo7: To queue To enable/disable PlantUML, update config.toml:\n[params.plantuml] enable = true Other optional settings are:\n[params.plantuml] enable = true theme = \"default\" #Set url to plantuml server #default is http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/ svg_image_url = \"https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/\" Customizing templates Add code to head or before body end If you need to add some code (CSS import or similar) to the head section on every page, add a partial to your project:\nlayouts/partials/hooks/head-end.html And add the code you need in that file. Your partial code is automatically included at the end of the theme partial head.html (the theme version of head-end.html is empty):\nSimilar, if you want to add some code right before the body end, create your own version of the following file:\nlayouts/partials/hooks/body-end.html Any code in this file is included automatically at the end of the theme partial scripts.html.\nBoth head.html and scripts.html are then used to build Docsy’s base page layout, which is used by all the other page templates:\n\u003c!doctype html\u003e \u003chtml lang=\"{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}\" class=\"no-js\"\u003e \u003chead\u003e {{ partial \"head.html\" . }} \u003c/head\u003e \u003cbody class=\"td-{{ .Kind }}\"\u003e \u003cheader\u003e {{ partial \"navbar.html\" . }} \u003c/header\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"container-fluid td-default td-outer\"\u003e \u003cmain role=\"main\" class=\"td-main\"\u003e {{ block \"main\" . }}{{ end }} \u003c/main\u003e {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }} \u003c/div\u003e {{ partialCached \"scripts.html\" . }} \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e ","categories":"","description":"Customize colors, fonts, and more for your site.\n","excerpt":"Customize colors, fonts, and more for your site.\n","ref":"/guide/appendix/lookandfeel/","tags":"","title":"Look and Feel"},{"body":"\r\r\rAddress\r7th Floor Keppel Center, Samar Loop cor Cardinal Rosales Avenue, Cebu Business Park, Cebu City, Philippines\r\r\rOffice Hours (General)\r08:30-12:30 13:30-17:15 Monday to Friday except holidays\r\r\rOffice Hours (Consular)\r08:40-12:30 14:00-16:30 Monday to Friday except holidays\r\r\rTelephone\r(+63-32) 231-7321, 231-7322\r\r\rFax\r(+63-32) 231-6843\r\r\r\r Official website of the Consular Office of Japan in Cebu  Google Map ","categories":"","description":"Visa application and other consular services for the Visayas Region\n","excerpt":"Visa application and other consular services for the Visayas Region\n","ref":"/guide/visa-application/japan-embassy-manila-philippines/cebu-consular-office/","tags":"","title":"Consular Office of Japan in Cebu"},{"body":"\r\r\rAddress\r4th Floor BI Zone Building, J.P.

All Hugo sites have a main menu array of menu entries, accessible via the .Site.Menus site variable and populatable via page front matter or your site’s config.toml.\nTo add a page or section to this menu, add it to the site’s main menu in either config.toml or in the destination page’s front matter (in _index.md or _index.html for a section, as that’s the section landing page). For example, here’s how we added the Documentation section landing page to the main menu in this site:\n---title:\"Welcome to Docsy\"linkTitle:\"Documentation\"menu:main:weight:20pre:\u003ci class='fas fa-book'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e---The menu is ordered from left to right by page weight. So, for example, a section index or page with weight: 30 would appear after the Documentation section in the menu, while one with weight: 10 would appear before it.\nIf you want to add a link to an external site to this menu, add it in config.toml, specifying the weight.\n[[menu.main]]name = \"GitHub\"weight = 50url = \"https://github.com/google/docsy/\"Adding icons to the top-level menu As described in the Hugo docs, you can add icons to the top-level menu by using the pre and/or post parameter for main menu items defined in your site’s config.toml or via page front matter. For example, the following configuration adds the GitHub icon to the GitHub menu item, and a New! alert to indicate that this is a new addition to the menu.\n[[menu.main]]name = \"GitHub\"weight = 50url = \"https://github.com/google/docsy/\"pre = \"\u003ci class='fab fa-github'\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\"post = \"\u003cspan class='alert'\u003eNew!\u003c/span\u003e\" You can find a complete list of icons to use in the FontAwesome documentation. Docsy includes the free FontAwesome icons by default.\nAdding a version drop-down If you add some [params.versions] in config.toml, the Docsy theme adds a version selector drop down to the top-level menu.\nYou can find out more in the guide to versioning your docs.\nAdding a language drop-down If you configure more than one language in config.toml, the Docsy theme adds a language selector drop down to the top-level menu. Selecting a language takes the user to the translated version of the current page, or the home page for the given language.\nYou can find out more in Multi-language support.\nSection menu The section menu, as shown in the left side of the docs section, is automatically built from the content tree. Like the top-level menu, it is ordered by page or section index weight (or by page creation date if weight is not set), with the page or index’s Title, or linkTitle if different, as its link title in the menu. If a section subfolder has pages other than _index.md or _index.html, those pages will appear as a submenu, again ordered by weight. For example, here’s the metadata for this page showing its weight and title:\n---title:\"Navigation and Search\"linkTitle:\"Navigation and Search\"date:2017-01-05weight:3description:\u003eCustomize site navigation and search for your Docsy site.---To hide a page or section from the menu, set toc_hide: true in front matter.\nBy default, the section menu shows the current section fully expanded all the way down. This may make the left nav too long and difficult to scan for bigger sites. Try setting site param ui.sidebar_menu_compact = true in config.toml.\nWith the compact menu (.ui.sidebar_menu_compact = true), only the current page’s ancestors, siblings and direct descendants are shown. You can use the optional parameter .ui.ul_show to set a desired menu depth to always be visible. For example, with .ui.ul_show = 1 the first menu level is always displayed.\nOn large sites (default: \u003e 2000 pages) the section menu is not generated for each page, but cached for the whole section. The HTML classes for marking the active menu item (and menu path) are then set using JS. You can adjust the limit for activating the cached section menu with the optional parameter .ui.sidebar_cache_limit.\nAdding icons to section menu It’s also possible to add icons to the section menu in the sidebar by setting the icon parameter in the page front matter (e.g. icon: fas fa-tools).\nYou can find a complete list of icons to use in the FontAwesome documentation. Docsy includes the free FontAwesome icons by default.\nOut of the box, if you want to use icons, you should define icons for all items on the same menu level in order to ensure an appropriate look. If the icons are used in a different way, individual CSS adjustments are likely necessary.\nAdd manual links to section menu By default the section menu is entirely generated from your section’s pages. If you want to add a manual link to this menu, such as a link to an external site or a page in a different section of your site, you can do this by creating a placeholder page file in the doc hierarchy with the appropriate weight and some special parameters in its metadata (frontmatter) to specify the link details.\nTo create a placeholder page, create a page file as usual in the directory where you want the link to show up in the menu, and add a manualLink parameter to its metadata. If a page has manualLink in its metadata, Docsy generates a link for it in the section menu for this page and in the section index (the list of the child pages of a section on a landing page - see description in the Docsy docs), but the link destination is replaced by the value of manualLink. The link text is the title (or linkTitle if set) of your placeholder page. You can optionally also set the title attribute of the link with the parameter manualLinkTitle and a link target with manualLinkTarget - for example if you want an external link to open in a new tab you can set the link target to _blank. Docsy automatically adds rel=noopener to links that open new tabs as a security best practice.\nYou can also use manualLink to add an additional cross reference to another existing page of your site. For internal links you can choose to use the parameter manualLinkRelref instead of manualLink to use the built-in Hugo function relref. If relref can’t find a unique page in your site, Hugo throws a error message.\nNote Although all generated menu and landing page links based on your placeholder file are set according to the parameters manualLink or manualLinkRelref, Hugo still generates a regular HTML site page for the file, albeit one with no generated links to it. To avoid confusion if users accidentally land on a generated placeholder page, we recommend specifying the URL for the external link in the normal content and / or page description of the page.  Breadcrumb navigation Breadcrumb navigation is enabled by default. To disable breadcrumb navigation, set site param ui.breadcrumb_disable = true in config.toml.\nSite search options Docsy offers multiple options that let your readers search your site content, so you can pick one that suits your needs. You can choose from:\n Google Custom Search Engine (GCSE), the default option, which uses Google’s index of your public site to generate a search results page. Algolia DocSearch, which uses Algolia’s indexing and search mechanism, and provides an organized dropdown of search results when your readers use the search box. Algolia DocSearch is free for public documentation sites. Local search with Lunr, which uses Javascript to index and search your site without the need to connect to external services. This option doesn’t require your site to be public.  If you enable any of these search options in your config.toml, a search box displays in the right of your top navigation bar. By default a search box also displays at the top of the section menu in the left navigation pane, which you can disable if you prefer, or if you’re using a search option that only works with the top search box.\nBe aware that if you accidentally enable more than one search option in your config.toml you may get unexpected results (for example, if you have added the .js for Algolia DocSearch, you’ll get Algolia results if you enable GCSE search but forget to disable Algolia search).\nDisabling the sidebar search box By default, the search box appears in both the top navigation bar and at the top of the sidebar left navigation pane. If you don’t want the sidebar search box, set sidebar_search_disable to true in config.toml:\nsidebar_search_disable = true Configure search with a Google Custom Search Engine By default Docsy uses a Google Custom Search Engine (GCSE) to search your site. To enable this feature, you’ll first need to make sure that you have built a public production version of your site, as otherwise your site won’t be crawled and indexed.\nSetting up site search   Deploy your site and ensure that it’s built with HUGO_ENV=\"production\", as Google will only crawl and index Docsy sites built with this setting (you probably don’t want your not-ready-for-prime-time site to be searchable!). You can specify this variable as a command line flag to Hugo:\n$ env HUGO_ENV=\"production\" hugo Alternatively, if you’re using Netlify, you can specify it as a Netlify deployment setting in netlify.toml or the Netlify UI, along with the Hugo version. It may take a day or so before your site has actual search results available.\n  Create a Google Custom Search Engine for your deployed site by clicking New search engine on the Custom Search page and following the instructions. Make a note of the ID for your new search engine.\n  Add any further configuration you want to your search engine using the Edit search engine options. In particular you may want to do the following:\n Select Look and feel. Change from the default Overlay layout to Results only, as this option means your search results are embedded in your search page rather than appearing in a separate box. Click Save to save your changes. Edit the default result link behavior so that search results from your site don’t open in a new tab. To do this, select Search Features - Advanced - Websearch Settings. In the Link Target field, type “_parent”. Click Save to save your changes.    Tip Your site search results should show up within a couple of days. If it takes longer than that, you can manually request that your site is indexed by submitting a sitemap through the Google Search Console.  Adding the search page Once you have your search engine set up, you can add the feature to your site:\n  Ensure you have a Markdown file in content/en/search.md (and one per other languages if needed) to display your search results. It only needs a title and layout: search, as in the following example:\n--- title: Search Results layout: search ---   Add your Google Custom Search Engine ID to the site params in config.toml. You can add different values per language if needed.\n# Google Custom Search Engine ID. Remove or comment out to disable search. gcs_engine_id = \"011737558837375720776:fsdu1nryfng\"   Disabling GCSE search If you don’t specify a Google Custom Search Engine ID for your project and haven’t enabled any other search options, the search box won’t appear in your site. If you’re using the default config.toml from the example site and want to disable search, just comment out or remove the relevant line.\nConfigure Algolia DocSearch As an alternative to GCSE, you can use Algolia DocSearch with this theme. Algolia DocSearch is free for public documentation sites.\nSign up for Algolia DocSearch Complete the form at https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/#join-docsearch-program.\nIf you are accepted to the program, you will receive the JavaScript code to add to your documentation site from Algolia by email.\nAdding Algolia DocSearch   Enable Algolia DocSearch in config.toml.\n# Enable Algolia DocSearch algolia_docsearch = true   Remove or comment out any GCSE ID in config.toml and ensure local search is set to false as you can only have one type of search enabled. See Disabling GCSE search.\n  Disable the sidebar search in config.toml as this is not currently supported for Algolia DocSearch. See Disabling the sidebar search box.\n  Add the JavaScript code provided to you by Algolia to the head and body of every page on your site. See Add code to head or before body end for details.\n  Update the inputSelector field in the body end Javascript with the appropriate CSS selector (e.g. .td-search-input to use the default CSS from this theme).\n  When you’ve completed these steps the Algolia search should be enabled on your site. Search results are displayed as a drop-down under the search box, so you don’t need to add any search results page.\nConfigure local search with Lunr Lunr is a Javascript-based search option that lets you index your site and make it searchable without the need for external, server-side search services. This is a good option particularly for smaller or non-public sites.\nTo add Lunr search to your Docsy site:\n  Enable local search in config.toml.\n# Enable local search offlineSearch = true   Remove or comment out any GCSE ID in config.toml and ensure Algolia DocSearch is set to false, as you can only have one type of search enabled. See Disabling GCSE search.\n  Once you’ve completed these steps, local search is enabled for your site and results appear in a drop down when you use the search box.\nTip If you’re testing this locally using Hugo’s local server functionality, you need to build your offline-search-index.xxx.json file first by running hugo. If you have the Hugo server running while you build offline-search-index.xxx.json, you may need to stop the server and restart it in order to see your search results.  Changing the summary length of the local search results You can customize the summary length by setting offlineSearchSummaryLength in config.toml.\n#Enable offline search with Lunr.js offlineSearch = true offlineSearchSummaryLength = 200 Changing the maximum result count of the local search You can customize the maximum result count by setting offlineSearchMaxResults in config.toml.\n#Enable offline search with Lunr.js offlineSearch = true offlineSearchMaxResults = 25 Changing the width of the local search results popover The width of the search results popover will automatically widen according to the content.\nIf you want to limit the width, add the following scss into assets/scss/_variables_project.scss.\nbody { .popover.offline-search-result { max-width: 460px; } } Excluding pages from local search results To exclude pages from local search results, add exclude_search: true to the the frontmatter of each page:\n---title:\"Index\"weight:10exclude_search:true---","categories":"","description":"Customize site navigation and search for your Docsy site.\n","excerpt":"Customize site navigation and search for your Docsy site.\n","ref":"/guide/appendix/navigation/","tags":"","title":"Navigation and Search"},{"body":"Rather than writing all your site pages from scratch, Hugo lets you define and use shortcodes. These are reusable snippets of content that you can include in your pages, often using HTML to create effects that are difficult or impossible to do in simple Markdown. Shortcodes can also have parameters that let you, for example, add your own text to a fancy shortcode text box. As well as Hugo’s built-in shortcodes, Docsy provides some shortcodes of its own to help you build your pages.\nShortcode blocks The theme comes with a set of custom Page Block shortcodes that can be used to compose landing pages, about pages, and similar.\nThese blocks share some common parameters:\n height A pre-defined height of the block container. One of min, med, max, full, or auto. Setting it to full will fill the Viewport Height, which can be useful for landing pages. color The block will be assigned a color from the theme palette if not provided, but you can set your own if needed. You can use all of Bootstrap’s color names, theme color names or a grayscale shade. Some examples would be primary, white, dark, warning, light, success, 300, blue, orange. This will become the background color of the block, but text colors will adapt to get proper contrast.  blocks/cover The blocks/cover shortcode creates a landing page type of block that fills the top of the page.\n{{\u003c blocks/cover title=\"Welcome!\" image_anchor=\"center\" height=\"full\" color=\"primary\" \u003e}} \u003cdiv class=\"mx-auto\"\u003e \u003ca class=\"btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4\" href=\"{{\u003c relref \"/docs\" \u003e}}\"\u003e Learn More \u003ci class=\"fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-right ml-2\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003ca class=\"btn btn-lg btn-secondary mr-3 mb-4\" href=\"https://example.org\"\u003e Download \u003ci class=\"fab fa-github ml-2 \"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e \u003c/a\u003e \u003cp class=\"lead mt-5\"\u003eThis program is now available in \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eAppStore!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cdiv class=\"mx-auto mt-5\"\u003e {{\u003c blocks/link-down color=\"info\" \u003e}} \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/div\u003e {{\u003c /blocks/cover \u003e}} Note that the relevant shortcode parameters above will have sensible defaults, but is included here for completeness.\nHugo Tip  Using the bracket styled shortcode delimiter, \u003e}}, tells Hugo that the inner content is HTML/plain text and needs no further processing.

To set the background image, place an image with the word “background” in the name in the page’s Page Bundle. For example, in our the example site the background image in the home page’s cover block is featured-background.jpg, in the same directory.\nTip If you also include the word featured in the image name, e.g. my-featured-background.jpg, it will also be used as the Twitter Card image when shared.  For available icons, see Font Awesome.\nblocks/lead The blocks/lead block shortcode is a simple lead/title block with centred text and an arrow down pointing to the next section.\n{{%blocks/leadcolor=\"dark\"%}} TechOS is the OS of the future.

One common use-case is to show multiple syntax highlighted code blocks that showcase the same problem, and how to solve it in different programming languages. As an example, the table below shows the language-specific variants of the famous Hello world! program one usually writes first when learning a new programming language from scratch:\nC  C++  Go  Java  Kotlin  Lua  PHP  Python  Ruby  Scala   #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003cstdlib.h\u003e int main(void) { puts(\"Hello World!\"); return EXIT_SUCCESS; } #include \u003ciostream\u003e int main() { std::cout \u003c\u003c \"Hello World!\" \u003c\u003c std::endl; }  package main import \"fmt\" func main() { fmt.Printf(\"Hello World!\\n\") }  class HelloWorld { static public void main( String args[] ) { System.out.println( \"Hello World!\" ); } } fun main(args : Array\u003cString\u003e) { println(\"Hello, world!\") } print \"Hello world\" \u003c?php echo 'Hello World!'; ?\u003e print(\"Hello World!\") puts \"Hello World!\" object HelloWorld extends App { println(\"Hello world!\") }  The Docsy template provides two shortcodes tabpane and tab that let you easily create tabbed panes. To see how to use them, have a look at the following code block, which renders to a pane with three tabs:\n{{\u003ctabpane\u003e}} {{\u003ctabheader=\"English\"\u003e}} Welcome! {{\u003c/tab\u003e}} {{\u003ctabheader=\"German\"\u003e}} Herzlich willkommen! {{\u003c/tab\u003e}} {{\u003ctabheader=\"Swahili\"\u003e}} Karibu sana! {{\u003c/tab\u003e}} {{\u003c/tabpane\u003e}} This code translates to the tabbed pane below, showing a Welcome! greeting in English, German or Swahili:\nEnglish  German  Swahili   Welcome! Herzlich willkommen! Karibu sana!  Shortcode details Tabbed panes are implemented using two shortcodes:\n The tabpane shortcode, which is the container element for the tabs. This shortcode can optionally held the named parameters lang and/or highlight. The values of these optional parameters are passed on as second LANG and third OPTIONS arguments to Hugo’s built-in highlight function which is used to render the code blocks of the individual tabs. In case the header text of the tab equals the language used in the tab’s code block (as in the first tabbed pane example above), you may specify langEqualsHeader=true in the surrounding tabpane shortcode. Then, the header text of the individual tab is automatically set as language parameter of the respective tab. The various tab shortcodes which actually represent the tabs you would like to show. We recommend specifying the named parameter header for each text in order to set the header text of each tab. If needed, you can additionally specify the named parameters lang and highlight for each tab. This allows you to overwrite the settings given in the parent tabpane shortcode. If the language is neither specified in the tabpane nor in the tabshortcode, it defaults to Hugo’s site variable .Site.Language.Lang.

This overrides the default Docsy logo in the theme. If you don’t want a project logo, set navbar_logo to false (or delete the variable) in your config.toml:\nnavbar_logo = false If you decide at a later stage that you’d like to add a logo to your navbar, you can set the parameter to true:\nnavbar_logo = true  Tip Your logo is included in the default Docsy navbar as an inline SVG with the following CSS styling (from _nav.scss):\nsvg { display: inline-block; margin: 0 10px; height: 30px; } To ensure your logo displays correctly, you may want to resize it, ensure it doesn’t have height and width attributes so that its size is fully responsive, or override the default styling with your own CSS.\n Add your favicons The easiest way to do this is to create a set of favicons via http://cthedot.de/icongen (which lets you create a huge range of icon sizes and options from a single image) and/or https://favicon.io, and put them in your site project’s static/favicons directory. This will override the default favicons from the theme.\nNote that https://favicon.io doesn’t create as wide a range of sizes as Icongen but does let you quickly create favicons from text: if you want to create text favicons you can use this site to generate them, then use Icongen to create more sizes (if necessary) from your generated .png file.\nIf you have special favicon requirements, you can create your own layouts/partials/favicons.html with your links.\nAdd images Landing pages Docsy’s blocks/cover shortcode make it easy to add large cover images to your landing pages. The shortcode looks for an image with the word “background” in the name inside the landing page’s Page Bundle - so, for example, if you’ve copied the example site, the landing page image in content/en/_index.html is content/en/featured-background.jpg.\nYou specify the preferred display height of a cover block container (and hence its image) using the block’s height parameter. For a full viewport height, use full:\n{{\u003c blocks/cover title=\"Welcome to the Docsy Example Project!\" image_anchor=\"top\" height=\"full\" color=\"orange\" \u003e}} ... {{\u003c /blocks/cover \u003e}} For a shorter image, as in the example site’s About page, use one of min, med, max or auto (the actual height of the image):\n{{\u003c blocks/cover title=\"About the Docsy Example\" image_anchor=\"bottom\" height=\"min\" \u003e}} ... {{\u003c /blocks/cover \u003e}} Other pages To add inline images to other pages, use the imgproc shortcode. Alternatively, if you prefer, just use regular Markdown or HTML images and add your image files to your project’s static directory. You can find out more about using this directory in Adding static content.\nImages used on this site Images used as background images in this site are in the public domain and can be used freely.

Selecting this option renders the entire current top-level section (such as Content and Customization for this page) with all of its child pages and sections in a format suited to printing, complete with a table of contents for the section.\nTo enable this feature, add the “print” output format in your site’s config.toml file for the “section” type:\n[outputs] section = [ \"HTML\", \"RSS\", \"print\" ] The site should then show a “Print entire section” link in the right hand navigation.\nFurther Customization Disabling the ToC To disable showing the the table of contents in the printable view, set the disable_toc param to true, either in the page front matter, or in config.toml:\n[params.print] disable_toc = true Layout hooks A number of layout partials and hooks are defined that can be used to customize the printed format. These can be found in layouts/partials/print.\nHooks can be defined on a per-type basis. For example, you may want to customize the layouts of heading for “blog” pages vs “docs”. This can be achieved by creating layouts/partials/print/page-heading-\u003ctype\u003e.html - eg. page-heading-blog.html.

An example Yes response   How is this data useful? When you have a lot of documentation, and not enough time to update it all, you can use the “was this page helpful?” feedback data to help you decide which pages to prioritize. In general, start with the pages with a lot of pageviews and low ratings. “Low ratings” in this context means the pages where users are clicking No — the page wasn’t helpful — more often than Yes — the page was helpful. You can also study your highly-rated pages to develop hypotheses around why your users find them helpful.\nIn general, you can develop more certainty around what patterns your users find helpful or unhelpful if you introduce isolated changes in your documentation whenever possible. For example, suppose that you find a tutorial that no longer matches the product. You update the instructions, check back in a month, and the score has improved. You now have a correlation between up-to-date instructions and higher ratings. Or, suppose you study your highly-rated pages and discover that they all start with code samples. You find 10 other pages with their code samples at the bottom, move the samples to the top, and discover that each page’s score has improved. Since this was the only change you introduced on each page, it’s more reasonable to believe that your users find code samples at the top of pages helpful. The scientific method, applied to technical writing, in other words!\nSetup   Open config.toml.\n  Ensure that Google Analytics is enabled, as described above.\n  Set the response text that users see after clicking Yes or No.\n [params.ui.feedback] enable = true yes = 'Glad to hear it!

For example, you should know how to check pageviews over a certain time range and navigate between accounts if you have access to multiple documentation sites.\n Open Google Analytics. Open Behavior \u003e Events \u003e Overview. In the Event Category table click the Helpful row. Click view full report if you don’t see the Helpful row. Click Event Label. You now have a page-by-page breakdown of ratings.  Here’s what the 4 columns represent:\n Total Events is the total number of times that users clicked either Yes or No. Unique Events provides a rough indication of how frequently users are rating your pages per session. For example, suppose your Total Events is 5000, and Unique Events is 2500. This means that you have 2500 users who are rating 2 pages per session. Event Value isn’t that useful. Avg. Value is the aggregated rating for that page. The value is always between 0 and 1. When users click No a value of 0 is sent to Google Analytics. When users click Yes a value of 1 is sent. You can think of it as a percentage. If a page has an Avg. Value of 0.67, it means that 67% of users clicked Yes and 33% clicked No.  The underlying Google Analytics infrastructure that stores the “was this page helpful?” data is called Events.

Walang kailangang lisensya, walang gastos para sa gasolina at kaunti lang ang kailangang maintenance.\nKung kailangan mo ng sasakyan para sa araw-araw na pagbili ng grocery, pagpunta sa malapit na park o community center, o pagbisita sa kaibigan mo na ilang kilometro lang ang layo mula sa apartment mo, ang bisikleta ang ideal na sasakyan para sa iyo.\nIba’t-ibang klase ng bisikleta Maraming klase ng bisikleta pero ang pinakapopular ay ang mga sumusunod.\nCity bike O ang tinatawag nilang mamachari (parang sa itaas), popular sa mga high schoolers na pampasok sa school, mga okaasan (kung saan galing ang salitang mamachiri) para mamalengke at maghatid-sundo ng mga bata (may angkasan) o mga sarariman na papunta sa eki.\nPROS\n Mura (mga 10,000 hanggang 30,000 yen) Madaling sakyan, lalo na ng mga babae Mayroon ng ilaw, lock at basket, may takip ang kadena  CONS\n Mabigat, mahirap dalhin sa malayo o lugar na hindi maganda ang daan  Mountain bike Mas sporty ang style at mas pamilyar sa mga Pinoy kaya marami ang may gusto nito.\nPROS\n Risonable ang presyo (mga 30,000 hanggang 80,000 yen) Mas magaang kaysa sa city bike at madaling sakyan Maaring sakyan sa mga lugar na hindi maganda ang daan  CONS\n Kailangang bilhin pa ang ilaw at lock Walang basket kaya walang lalagyan ng grocery (puwedeng lagyan as option) Karamihan ay walang fender ang gulong  Road bike Parang mountain bike ang hugis pero mas manipis ang gulong at magaang ang katawan para mabilis na puwedeng sakyan sa mga daan. Hindi magandang sasakyan sa pang araw-araw na gawain.\nPROS\n Magaang ang katawan kaya mabilis sa daan kumpara sa mga naunang bisikleta  CONS\n Mahal (mga 50,000 hanggang 120,000 yen) Kailangang bilhin pa ang ilaw at lock Walang basket kaya walang lalagyan ng grocery (puwedeng lagyan as option) Walang fender at manipis ang gulong kaya hindi magandang sakyan off-road  Saan puwedeng bumili Ang mga city bike ay mabibili sa kahit saang home center. Kung gusto mo ng disenteng seleksyon ng mountain bike at road bike ay magandang sa bicycle store na kagaya ng Asahi Bicycle ka pumunta. Ang mga high-end na road bike ay sa mga specialty bike store makikita.\nMAG-INGAT: Maari ding mag-order online ng bisikleta pero walang mahirap kumuha ng support kapag nagkaroon ng problema. Kailangan ding ipa-register ang bisikleta at karamihan ay ginagawa ito ng pinagbilhang tindahan pero hindi ginagawa ito ng mga online store kaya kailangang ikaw mismo ang magpa-register sa lugar sa malapit sa tirahan mo.  Panuntunan sa pagsakay ng bisikleta Mukhang simple lang ang pagsakay ng bisikleta pero maraming rules na kailangang maging pamilyar tayo para maging ligtas at komportable ang pagbibisikleta.\n Ang bisikleta ay isang uri ng sasakyan kaya ang daanan nito ay sa kalsada, hindi sa sidewalk (puwera ang mga batang wala pang 13 taong gulang at mga matatandang 70 taon pataas, o mga taong may kapansanan). Sa kaliwang bahagi ng kalsada dumaan. Bawal mag-angkas (puwedeng iangkas ang mga batang 6 taon at pababa). Bawal ang magkatabing nagbibisikleta sa kalsada. Kailangang may ilaw at reflector ang bisikleta sa gabi. Bawal gumamit ng cellphone habang nagbibisikleta. Bawal gumamit ng payong habang nagbibisikleta. Bawal sumakay sa bisikleta nang nakainom ng alak. Maaaring dumaan sa sidewalk kung makaramdam ng panganib sa kalsada, pero kailangang bigyan ng priority ang mga naglalakad at dahan-dahan lang ang takbo. Sa bahagi ng sidewalk o pedestrian lane na may nakalagay ng marka ng bisikleta, doon lang sa lane na iyon dumaan. Sumunod sa traffic light.

The reader flies in his express train in a few minutes through a couple of centuries. The centuries pass more slowly to those to whom the years are doled out day by day. Institutions grow and beneficently develop themselves, making their way into the hearts of generations which are shorter-lived than they, attracting love and respect, and winning loyal obedience; and then as gradually forfeiting by their shortcomings the allegiance which had been honorably gained in worthier periods. We see wealth and greatness; we see corruption and vice; and one seems to follow so close upon the other, that we fancy they must have always co-existed. We look more steadily, and we perceive long periods of time, in which there is first a growth and then a decay, like what we perceive in a tree of the forest.”\n FROUDE, Annals of an English Abbey\nMonasticism’s record in the Philippines presents no new general fact to the eye of history. The attempt to eliminate the eternal feminine from her natural and normal sphere in the scheme of things there met with the same certain and signal disaster that awaits every perversion of human activity. Beginning with a band of zealous, earnest men, sincere in their convictions, to whom the cause was all and their personalities nothing, it there, as elsewhere, passed through its usual cycle of usefulness, stagnation, corruption, and degeneration.\nTo the unselfish and heroic efforts of the early friars Spain in large measure owed her dominion over the Philippine Islands and the Filipinos a marked advance on the road to civilization and nationality. In fact, after the dreams of sudden wealth from gold and spices had faded, the islands were retained chiefly as a missionary conquest and a stepping-stone to the broader fields of Asia, with Manila as a depot for the Oriental trade. The records of those early years are filled with tales of courage and heroism worthy of Spain’s proudest years, as the missionary fathers labored with unflagging zeal in disinterested endeavor for the spread of the Faith and the betterment of the condition of the Malays among whom they found themselves. They won the confidence of the native peoples, gathered them into settlements and villages, led them into the ways of peace, and became their protectors, guides, and counselors.\nIn those times the cross and the sword went hand in hand, but in the Philippines the latter was rarely needed or used. The lightness and vivacity of the Spanish character, with its strain of Orientalism, its fertility of resource in meeting new conditions, its adaptability in dealing with the dwellers in warmer lands, all played their part in this as in the other conquests. Only on occasions when some stubborn resistance was met with, as in Manila and the surrounding country, where the most advanced of the native peoples dwelt and where some of the forms and beliefs of Islam had been established, was it necessary to resort to violence to destroy the native leaders and replace them with the missionary fathers. A few sallies by young Salcedo, the Cortez of the Philippine conquest, with a company of the splendid infantry, which was at that time the admiration and despair of martial Europe, soon effectively exorcised any idea of resistance that even the boldest and most intransigent of the native leaders might have entertained.\nFor the most part, no great persuasion was needed to turn a simple, imaginative, fatalistic people from a few vague animistic deities to the systematic iconology and the elaborate ritual of the Spanish Church. An obscure Bathala or a dim Malyari was easily superseded by or transformed into a clearly defined Diós, and in the case of any especially tenacious “demon,” he could without much difficulty be merged into a Christian saint or devil. There was no organized priesthood to be overcome, the primitive religious observances consisting almost entirely of occasional orgies presided over by an old woman, who filled the priestly offices of interpreter for the unseen powers and chief eater at the sacrificial feast. With their unflagging zeal, their organization, their elaborate forms and ceremonies, the missionaries were enabled to win the confidence of the natives, especially as the greater part of them learned the local language and identified their lives with the communities under their care. Accordingly, the people took kindly to their new teachers and rulers, so that in less than a generation Spanish authority was generally recognized in the settled portions of the Philippines, and in the succeeding years the missionaries gradually extended this area by forming settlements from among the wilder peoples, whom they persuaded to abandon the more objectionable features of their old roving, often predatory, life and to group themselves into towns and villages “under the bell.”\nThe tactics employed in the conquest and the subsequent behavior of the conquerors were true to the old Spanish nature, so succinctly characterized by a plain-spoken Englishman of Mary’s reign, when the war-cry of Castile encircled the globe and even hovered ominously near the “sceptered isle,” when in the intoxication of power character stands out so sharply defined: “They be verye wyse and politicke, and can, thorowe ther wysdome, reform and brydell theyr owne natures for a tyme, and applye ther conditions to the manners of those men with whom they meddell gladlye by friendshippe; whose mischievous maners a man shall never know untyll he come under ther subjection; but then shall he parfectlye parceve and fele them: for in dissimulations untyll they have ther purposes, and afterwards in oppression and tyrannye, when they can obtain them, they do exceed all other nations upon the earthe.”[1]\nIn the working out of this spirit, with all the indomitable courage and fanatical ardor derived from the long contests with the Moors, they reduced the native peoples to submission, but still not to the galling yoke which they fastened upon the aborigines of America, to make one Las Casas shine amid the horde of Pizarros. There was some compulsory labor in timber-cutting and ship-building, with enforced military service as rowers and soldiers for expeditions to the Moluccas and the coasts of Asia, but nowhere the unspeakable atrocities which in Mexico, Hispaniola, and South America drove mothers to strangle their babes at birth and whole tribes to prefer self-immolation to the living death in the mines and slave-pens. Quite differently from the case in America, where entire islands and districts were depopulated, to bring on later the curse of negro slavery, in the Philippines the fact appears that the native population really increased and the standard of living was raised under the stern, yet beneficent, tutelage of the missionary fathers. The great distance and the hardships of the journey precluded the coming of many irresponsible adventurers from Spain and, fortunately for the native population, no great mineral wealth was ever discovered in the Philippine Islands.\nThe system of government was, in its essential features, a simple one. The missionary priests drew the inhabitants of the towns and villages about themselves or formed new settlements, and with profuse use of symbol and symbolism taught the people the Faith, laying particular stress upon “the fear of God,” as administered by them, reconciling the people to their subjection by inculcating the Christian virtues of patience and humility. When any recalcitrants refused to accept the new order, or later showed an inclination to break away from it, the military forces, acting usually under secret directions from the padre, made raids in the disaffected parts with all the unpitying atrocity the Spanish soldiery were ever capable of displaying in their dealings with a weaker people. After sufficient punishment had been inflicted and a wholesome fear inspired, the padre very opportunely interfered in the natives’ behalf, by which means they were convinced that peace and security lay in submission to the authorities, especially to the curate of their town or district. A single example will suffice to make the method clear: not an isolated instance but a typical case chosen from among the mass of records left by the chief actors themselves.\nFray Domingo Perez, evidently a man of courage and conviction, for he later lost his life in the work of which he wrote, was the Dominican vicar on the Zambales coast when that Order temporarily took over the district from the Recollects. In a report written for his superior in 1680 he outlines the method clearly: “In order that those whom we have assembled in the three villages may persevere in their settlements, the most efficacious fear and the one most suited to their nature is that the Spaniards of the fort and presidio of Paynaven[2] of whom they have a very great fear, may come very often to the said villages and overrun the land, and penetrate even into their old recesses where they formerly lived; and if perchance they should find anything planted in the said recesses that they would destroy it and cut it down without leaving them anything. And so that they may see the father protects them, when the said Spaniards come to the village, the father opposes them and takes the part of the Indians. But it is always necessary in this matter for the soldiers to conquer, and the father is always very careful always to inform the Spaniards by whom and where anything is planted which it may be necessary to destroy, and that the edicts which his Lordship, the governor, sent them be carried out …. But at all events said Spaniards are to make no trouble for the Indians whom they find in the villages, but rather must treat them well.”[3]\nThis in 1680: the Dominican transcriber of the record in 1906 has added a very illuminating note, revealing the immutability of the system and showing that the rulers possessed in a superlative degree the Bourbonesque trait of learning nothing and forgetting nothing: “Even when I was a missionary to the heathens from 1882 to 1892, I had occasion to observe the said policy, to inform the chief of the fortress of the measures that he ought to take, and to make a false show on the other side so that it might have no influence on the fortress.”\nThus it stands out in bold relief as a system built up and maintained by fraud and force, bound in the course of nature to last only as long as the deception could be carried on and the repressive force kept up to sufficient strength. Its maintenance required that the different sections be isolated from each other so that there could be no growth toward a common understanding and coöperation, and its permanence depended upon keeping the people ignorant and contented with their lot, held under strict control by religious and political fear.\nYet it was a vast improvement over their old mode of life [x]and their condition was bettered as they grew up to such a system. Only with the passing of the years and the increase of wealth and influence, the ease and luxury invited by these, and the consequent corruption so induced, with the insatiable longing ever for more wealth and greater influence, did the poison of greed and grasping power enter the system to work its insidious way into every part, slowly transforming the beneficent institution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries into an incubus weighing upon all the activities of the people in the nineteenth, an unyielding bar to the development of the country, a hideous anachronism in these modern times.\nIt must be remembered also that Spain, in the years following her brilliant conquests of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, lost strength and vigor through the corruption at home induced by the unearned wealth that flowed into the mother country from the colonies, and by the draining away of her best blood. Nor did her sons ever develop that economic spirit which is the permanent foundation of all empire, but they let the wealth of the Indies flow through their country, principally to London and Amsterdam, there to form in more practical hands the basis of the British and Dutch colonial empires.\nThe priest and the soldier were supreme, so her best sons took up either the cross or the sword to maintain her dominion in the distant colonies, a movement which, long continued, spelled for her a form of national suicide. The soldier expended his strength and generally laid down his life on alien soil, leaving no fit successor of his own stock to carry on the work according to his standards. The priest under the celibate system, in its better days left no offspring at all and in the days of its corruption none bred and reared under the influences that make for social and political progress. The dark chambers of the Inquisition stifled all advance in thought, so the civilization and the culture of Spain, as well as her political system, settled into rigid forms to await only the inevitable process of stagnation and decay. In her proudest hour an old soldier, who had lost one of his hands fighting her battles against the Turk at Lepanto, employed the other in writing the masterpiece of her literature, which is really a caricature of the nation.\nThere is much in the career of Spain that calls to mind the dazzling beauty of her “dark-glancing daughters,” with its early bloom, its startling—almost morbid—brilliance, and its premature decay. Rapid and brilliant was her rise, gradual and inglorious her steady decline, from the bright morning when the banners of Castile and Aragon were flung triumphantly from the battlements of the Alhambra, to the short summer, not so long gone, when at Cavite and Santiago with swift, decisive havoc the last ragged remnants of the once world-dominating power were blown into space and time, to hover disembodied there, a lesson and a warning to future generations. Whatever her final place in the records of mankind, whether as the pioneer of modern civilization or the buccaneer of the nations or, as would seem most likely, a goodly mixture of both, she has at least—with the exception only of her great mother, Rome—furnished the most instructive lessons in political pathology yet recorded, and the advice to students of world progress to familiarize themselves with her history is even more apt today than when it first issued from the encyclopedic mind of Macaulay nearly a century ago. Hardly had she reached the zenith of her power when the disintegration began, and one by one her brilliant conquests dropped away, to leave her alone in her faded splendor, with naught but her vaunting pride left, another “Niobe of nations.” In the countries more in contact with the trend of civilization and more susceptible to revolutionary influences from the mother country this separation came from within, while in the remoter parts the archaic and outgrown system dragged along until a stronger force from without destroyed it.\nNowhere was the crystallization of form and principle more pronounced than in religious life, which fastened upon the mother country a deadening weight that hampered all progress, and in the colonies, notably in the Philippines, virtually converted her government into a hagiarchy that had its face toward the past and either could not or would not move with the current of the times. So, when “the shot heard round the world,” the declaration of humanity’s right to be and to become, in its all-encircling sweep, reached the lands controlled by her it was coldly received and blindly rejected by the governing powers, and there was left only the slower, subtler, but none the less sure, process of working its way among the people to burst in time in rebellion and the destruction of the conservative forces that would repress it.\nIn the opening years of the nineteenth century the friar orders in the Philippines had reached the apogee of their power and usefulness. Their influence was everywhere felt and acknowledged, while the country still prospered under the effects of the vigorous and progressive administrations of Anda and Vargas in the preceding century. Native levies had fought loyally under Spanish leadership against Dutch and British invaders, or in suppressing local revolts among their own people, which were always due to some specific grievance, never directed definitely against the Spanish sovereignty. The Philippines were shut off from contact with any country but Spain, and even this communication was restricted and carefully guarded. There was an elaborate central government which, however, hardly touched the life of the native peoples, who were guided and governed by the parish priests, each town being in a way an independent entity.\nOf this halcyon period, just before the process of disintegration began, there has fortunately been left a record which may be characterized as the most notable Spanish literary production relating to the Philippines, being the calm, sympathetic, judicial account of one who had spent his manhood in the work there and who, full of years and experience, sat down to tell the story of their life.[4] In it there are no puerile whinings, no querulous curses that tropical Malays do not order their lives as did the people of the Spanish village where he may have been reared, no selfish laments of ingratitude over blessings unasked and only imperfectly understood by the natives, no fatuous self-deception as to the real conditions, but a patient consideration of the difficulties encountered, the good accomplished, and the unavoidable evils incident to any human work. The country and the people, too, are described with the charming simplicity of the eyes that see clearly, the brain that ponders deeply, and the heart that beats sympathetically. Through all the pages of his account runs the quiet strain of peace and contentment, of satisfaction with the existing order, for he had looked upon the creation and saw that it was good. There is “neither haste, nor hate, nor anger,” but the deliberate recital of the facts warmed and illumined by the geniality of a soul to whom age and experience had brought, not a sour cynicism, but the mellowing influence of a ripened philosophy. He was such an old man as may fondly be imagined walking through the streets of Parañaque in stately benignity amid the fear and respect of the brown people over whom he watched.\nBut in all his chronicle there is no suggestion of anything more to hope for, anything beyond. Beautiful as the picture is, it is that of a system which had reached maturity: a condition of stagnation, not of growth. In less than a decade, the terrific convulsions in European politics made themselves felt even in the remote Philippines, and then began the gradual drawing away of the people from their rulers—blind gropings and erratic wanderings at first, but nevertheless persistent and vigorous tendencies.\nThe first notable influence was the admission of representatives for the Philippines into the Spanish Cortes under the revolutionary governments and the abolition of the trade monopoly with Mexico. The last galleon reached Manila in 1815, and soon foreign commercial interests were permitted, in a restricted way, to enter the country. Then with the separation of Mexico and the other American colonies from Spain a more marked change was brought about in that direct communication was established with the mother country, and the absolutism of the hagiarchy first questioned by the numbers of Peninsular Spaniards who entered the islands to trade, some even to settle and rear families there. These also affected the native population in the larger centers by the spread of their ideas, which were not always in conformity with those that for several centuries the friars had been inculcating into their wards. Moreover, there was a not-inconsiderable portion of the population, sprung from the friars themselves, who were eager to adopt the customs and ideas of the Spanish immigrants.\nThe suppression of many of the monasteries in Spain in 1835 caused a large influx of the disestablished monks into the Philippines in search for a haven, and a home, thus bringing about a conflict with the native clergy, who were displaced from their best holdings to provide berths for the newcomers. At the same time, the increase of education among the native priests brought the natural demand for more equitable treatment by the Spanish friar, so insistent that it even broke out into open rebellion in 1843 on the part of a young Tagalog who thought himself aggrieved in this respect.\nThus the struggle went on, with stagnation above and some growth below, so that the governors were ever getting further away from the governed, and for such a movement there is in the course of nature but one inevitable result, especially when outside influences are actively at work penetrating the social system and making for better things. Among these influences four cumulative ones may be noted: the spread of journalism, the introduction of steamships into the Philippines, the return of the Jesuits, and the opening of the Suez Canal.\nThe printing-press entered the islands with the conquest, but its use had been strictly confined to religious works until about the middle of the past century, when there was a sudden awakening and within a few years five journals were being published. In 1848 appeared the first regular newspaper of importance, El Diario de Manila, and about a decade later the principal organ of the Spanish-Filipino population, El Comercio, which, with varying vicissitudes, has continued down to the present. While rigorously censored, both politically and religiously, and accessible to only an infinitesimal portion of the people, they still performed the service of letting a few rays of light into the Cimmerian intellectual gloom of the time and place.\nWith the coming of steam navigation communication between the different parts of the islands was facilitated and trade encouraged, with all that such a change meant in the way of breaking up the old isolation and tending to a common understanding. Spanish power, too, was for the moment more firmly established, and Moro piracy in Luzon and the Bisayan Islands, which had been so great a drawback to the development of the country, was forever ended.\nThe return of the Jesuits produced two general results tending to dissatisfaction with the existing order. To them was assigned the missionary field of Mindanao, which meant the displacement of the Recollect Fathers in the missions there, and for these other berths had to be found. Again the native clergy were the losers in that they had to give up their best parishes in Luzon, especially around Manila and Cavite, so the breach was further widened and the soil sown with discontent. But more far-reaching than this immediate result was the educational movement inaugurated by the Jesuits. The native, already feeling the vague impulses from without and stirred by the growing restlessness of the times, here saw a new world open before him. A considerable portion of the native population in the larger centers, who had shared in the economic progress of the colony, were enabled to look beyond their daily needs and to afford their children an opportunity for study and advancement—a condition and a need met by the Jesuits for a time.\nWith the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 communication with the mother country became cheaper, quicker, surer, so that large numbers of Spaniards, many of them in sympathy with the republican movements at home, came to the Philippines in search of fortunes and generally left half-caste families who had imbibed their ideas. Native boys who had already felt the intoxication of such learning as the schools of Manila afforded them began to dream of greater wonders in Spain, now that the journey was possible for them. So began the definite movements that led directly to the disintegration of the friar régime.\nIn the same year occurred the revolution in the mother country, which had tired of the old corrupt despotism. Isabella II was driven into exile and the country left to waver about uncertainly for several years, passing through all the stages of government from red radicalism to absolute conservatism, finally adjusting itself to the middle course of constitutional monarchism. During the effervescent and ephemeral republic there was sent to the Philippines a governor who set to work to modify the old system and establish a government more in harmony with modern ideas and more democratic in form. His changes were hailed with delight by the growing class of Filipinos who were striving for more consideration in their own country, and who, in their enthusiasm and the intoxication of the moment, perhaps became more radical than was safe under the conditions—surely too radical for their religious guides watching and waiting behind the veil of the temple.\nIn January, 1872, an uprising occurred in the naval arsenal at Cavite, with a Spanish non-commissioned officer as one of the leaders. From the meager evidence now obtainable, this would seem to have been purely a local mutiny over the service questions of pay and treatment, but in it the friars saw their opportunity. It was blazoned forth, with all the wild panic that was to characterize the actions of the governing powers from that time on, as the premature outbreak of a general insurrection under the leadership of the native clergy, and rigorous repressive measures were demanded. Three native priests, notable for their popularity among their own people, one an octogenarian and the other two young canons of the Manila Cathedral, were summarily garroted, along with the renegade Spanish officer who had participated in the mutiny. No record of any trial of these priests has ever been brought to light. The Archbishop, himself a secular[5] clergyman, stoutly refused to degrade them from their holy office, and they wore their sacerdotal robes at the execution, which was conducted in a hurried, fearful manner. At the same time a number of young Manilans who had taken conspicuous part in the “liberal” demonstrations were deported to the Ladrone Islands or to remote islands of the Philippine group itself.\nThis was the beginning of the end. Yet there immediately followed the delusive calm which ever precedes the fatal outburst, lulling those marked for destruction to a delusive security. The two decades following were years of quiet, unobtrusive growth, during which the Philippine Islands made the greatest economic progress in their history. But this in itself was preparing the final catastrophe, for if there be any fact well established in human experience it is that with economic development the power of organized religion begins to wane—the rise of the merchant spells the decline of the priest. A sordid change, from masses and mysteries to sugar and shoes, this is often said to be, but it should be noted that the epochs of greatest economic activity have been those during which the generality of mankind have lived fuller and freer lives, and above all that in such eras the finest intellects and the grandest souls have been developed.\nNor does an institution that has been slowly growing for three centuries, molding the very life and fiber of the people, disintegrate without a violent struggle, either in its own constitution or in the life of the people trained under it. Not only the ecclesiastical but also the social and political system of the country was controlled by the religious orders, often silently and secretly, but none the less effectively. This is evident from the ceaseless conflict that went on between the religious orders and the Spanish political administrators, who were at every turn thwarted in their efforts to keep the government abreast of the times.\nThe shock of the affair of 1872 had apparently stunned the Filipinos, but it had at the same time brought them to the parting of the ways and induced a vague feeling that there was something radically wrong, which could only be righted by a closer union among themselves. They began to consider that their interests and those of the governing powers were not the same. In these feelings of distrust toward the friars they were stimulated by the great numbers of immigrant Spaniards who were then entering the country, many of whom had taken part in the republican movements at home and who, upon the restoration of the monarchy, no doubt thought it safer for them to be at as great a distance as possible from the throne. The young Filipinos studying in Spain came from different parts of the islands, and by their association there in a foreign land were learning to forget their narrow sectionalism; hence the way was being prepared for some concerted action. Thus, aided and encouraged by the anti-clerical Spaniards in the mother country, there was growing up a new generation of native leaders, who looked toward something better than the old system.\nIt is with this period in the history of the country—the author’s boyhood—that the story of Noli Me Tangere deals. Typical scenes and characters are sketched from life with wonderful accuracy, and the picture presented is that of a master-mind, who knew and loved his subject. Terror and repression were the order of the day, with ever a growing unrest in the higher circles, while the native population at large seemed to be completely cowed—“brutalized” is the term repeatedly used by Rizal in his political essays. Spanish writers of the period, observing only the superficial movements,—some of which were indeed fantastical enough, for\n “they,\nWho in oppression’s darkness caved have dwelt,\nThey are not eagles, nourished with the day;\nWhat marvel, then, at times, if they mistake their way?”\n —and not heeding the currents at work below, take great delight in ridiculing the pretensions of the young men seeking advancement, while they indulge in coarse ribaldry over the wretched condition of the great mass of the “Indians.” The author, however, himself a “miserable Indian,” vividly depicts the unnatural conditions and dominant characters produced under the outworn system of fraud and force, at the same time presenting his people as living, feeling, struggling individuals, with all the frailties of human nature and all the possibilities of mankind, either for good or evil; incidentally he throws into marked contrast the despicable depreciation used by the Spanish writers in referring to the Filipinos, making clear the application of the self-evident proposition that no ordinary human being in the presence of superior force can very well conduct himself as a man unless he be treated as such.\nThe friar orders, deluded by their transient triumph and secure in their pride of place, became more arrogant, more domineering than ever. In the general administration the political rulers were at every turn thwarted, their best efforts frustrated, and if they ventured too far their own security threatened; for in the three-cornered wrangle which lasted throughout the whole of the Spanish domination, the friar orders had, in addition to the strength derived from their organization and their wealth, the Damoclean weapon of control over the natives to hang above the heads of both governor and archbishop. The curates in the towns, always the real rulers, became veritable despots, so that no voice dared to raise itself against them, even in the midst of conditions which the humblest indio was beginning to feel dumbly to be perverted and unnatural, and that, too, after three centuries of training under the system that he had ever been taught to accept as “the will of God.”\nThe friars seemed long since to have forgotten those noble aims that had meant so much to the founders and early workers of their orders, if indeed the great majority of those of the later day had ever realized the meaning of their office, for the Spanish writers of the time delight in characterizing them as the meanest of the Spanish peasantry, when not something worse, who had been “lassoed,” taught a few ritualistic prayers, and shipped to the Philippines to be placed in isolated towns as lords and masters of the native population, with all the power and prestige over a docile people that the sacredness of their holy office gave them. These writers treat the matter lightly, seeing in it rather a huge joke on the “miserable Indians,” and give the friars great credit for “patriotism,” a term which in this connection they dragged from depth to depth until it quite aptly fitted Dr. Johnson’s famous definition, “the last refuge of a scoundrel.”\nIn their conduct the religious corporations, both as societies and as individuals, must be estimated according to their own standards—the application of any other criterion would be palpably unfair. They undertook to hold the native in subjection, to regulate the essential activities of his life according to their ideas, so upon them must fall the responsibility for the conditions finally attained: to destroy the freedom of the subject and then attempt to blame him for his conduct is a paradox into which the learned men often fell, perhaps inadvertently through their deductive logic. They endeavored to shape the lives of their Malay wards not only in this existence but also in the next. Their vows were poverty, chastity, and obedience.\nThe vow of poverty was early relegated to the limbo of neglect. Only a few years after the founding of Manila royal decrees began to issue on the subject of complaints received by the King over the usurpation of lands on the part of the priests. Using the same methods so familiar in the heyday of the institution of monasticism in Europe—pious gifts, deathbed bequests, pilgrims’ offerings—the friar orders gradually secured the richest of the arable lands in the more thickly settled portions of the Philippines, notably the part of Luzon occupied by the Tagalogs. Not always, however, it must in justice be recorded, were such doubtful means resorted to, for there were instances where the missionary was the pioneer, gathering about himself a band of devoted natives and plunging into the unsettled parts to build up a town with its fields around it, which would later become a friar estate. With the accumulated incomes from these estates and the fees for religious observances that poured into their treasuries, the orders in their nature of perpetual corporations became the masters of the situation, the lords of the country. But this condition was not altogether objectionable; it was in the excess of their greed that they went astray, for the native peoples had been living under this system through generations and not until they began to feel that they were not receiving fair treatment did they question the authority of a power which not only secured them a peaceful existence in this life but also assured them eternal felicity in the next.\nWith only the shining exceptions that are produced in any system, no matter how false its premises or how decadent it may become, to uphold faith in the intrinsic soundness of human nature, the vow of chastity was never much more than a myth. Through the tremendous influence exerted over a fanatically religious people, who implicitly followed the teachings of the reverend fathers, once their confidence had been secured, the curate was seldom to be gainsaid in his desires. By means of the secret influence in the confessional and the more open political power wielded by him, the fairest was his to command, and the favored one and her people looked upon the choice more as an honor than otherwise, for besides the social standing that it gave her there was the proud prospect of becoming the mother of children who could claim kinship with the dominant race. The curate’s “companion” or the sacristan’s wife was a power in the community, her family was raised to a place of importance and influence among their own people, while she and her ecclesiastical offspring were well cared for. On the death or removal of the curate, it was almost invariably found that she had been provided with a husband or protector and a not inconsiderable amount of property—an arrangement rather appealing to a people among whom the means of living have ever been so insecure.\nThat this practise was not particularly offensive to the people among whom they dwelt may explain the situation, but to claim that it excuses the friars approaches dangerously close to casuistry. Still, as long as this arrangement was decently and moderately carried out, there seems to have been no great objection, nor from a worldly point of view, with all the conditions considered, could there be much. But the old story of excess, of unbridled power turned toward bad ends, again recurs, at the same time that the ideas brought in by the Spaniards who came each year in increasing numbers and the principles observed by the young men studying in Europe cast doubt upon the fitness of such a state of affairs. As they approached their downfall, like all mankind, the friars became more open, more insolent, more shameless, in their conduct.\nThe story of Maria Clara, as told in Noli Me Tangere, is by no means an exaggerated instance, but rather one of the few clean enough to bear the light, and her fate, as depicted in the epilogue, is said to be based upon an actual occurrence with which the author must have been familiar.\nThe vow of obedience—whether considered as to the Pope, their highest religious authority, or to the King of Spain, their political liege—might not always be so callously disregarded, but it could be evaded and defied. From the Vatican came bull after bull, from the Escorial decree after decree, only to be archived in Manila, sometimes after a hollow pretense of compliance. A large part of the records of Spanish domination is taken up with the wearisome quarrels that went on between the Archbishop, representing the head of the Church, and the friar orders, over the questions of the episcopal visitation and the enforcement of the provisions of the Council of Trent relegating the monks to their original status of missionaries, with the friars invariably victorious in their contentions. Royal decrees ordering inquiries into the titles to the estates of the men of poverty and those providing for the education of the natives in Spanish were merely sneered at and left to molder in harmless quiet. Not without good grounds for his contention, the friar claimed that the Spanish dominion over the Philippines depended upon him, and he therefore confidently set himself up as the best judge of how that dominion should be maintained.\nThus there are presented in the Philippines of the closing quarter of the century just past the phenomena so frequently met with in modern societies, so disheartening to the people who must drag out their lives under them, of an old system which has outworn its usefulness and is being called into question, with forces actively at work disintegrating it, yet with the unhappy folk bred and reared under it unprepared for a new order of things. The old faith was breaking down, its forms and beliefs, once so full of life and meaning, were being sharply examined, doubt and suspicion were the order of the day. Moreover, it must ever be borne in mind that in the Philippines this unrest, except in the parts where the friars were the landlords, was not general among the people, the masses of whom were still sunk in their “loved Egyptian night,” but affected only a very small proportion of the population—for the most part young men who were groping their way toward something better, yet without any very clearly conceived idea of what that better might be, and among whom was to be found the usual sprinkling of “sunshine patriots” and omnipresent opportunists ready for any kind of trouble that will afford them a chance to rise.\nAdd to the apathy of the masses dragging out their vacant lives amid the shadows of religious superstition and to the unrest of the few, the fact that the orders were in absolute control of the political machinery of the country, with the best part of the agrarian wealth amortized in their hands; add also the ever-present jealousies, petty feuds, and racial hatreds, for which Manila and the Philippines, with their medley of creeds and races, offer such a fertile field, all fostered by the governing class for the maintenance of the old Machiavelian principle of “divide and rule,” and the sum is about the most miserable condition under which any portion of mankind ever tried to fulfill nature’s inexorable laws of growth.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/translators-introduction-i/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/guide/keywords/mnop/","tags":"","title":"M ･ N ･ O ･ P"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/guide/keywords/qrst/","tags":"","title":"Q ･ R ･ S ･ T"},{"body":"Napapagod ka na sa pagbibisikleta, pero mahirap (o mahal) kumuha ng driver’s license?

Kailangan mong maglabas ng 7,800 yen. 7,800 yen lang! Wala pang isang lapad! Kung lisensya ng kotse ay minimum 300,000 yen ang bayad, kaya sulit na sulit ang 7,800 para may “motor” ka na.\n   Para saan Bayad (yen)     Testing fee 1,650   Scooter training course fee 4,050   Issuance fee 2,100   Total 7,800    Ano ang qualification na kailangan? Una, kailangang marunong kang mag-bisikleta siyempre. Hindi ka pwedeng mag-scooter nang hindi ka marunong mag-bisikleta, obvious naman siguro yan. At kailangan ay may 16 taong gulang ka na. (Sa driver’s license kailangan ay at least 18 years old ka na.)\n Kailangan ay nakakarinig ka ng 90db sa layong 10 meters Hindi ka color blind: alam mo ang pagkakaiba sa pula, green at yellow Wala kang kapansanan sa katawan Dapat at least 0.5 ang bawat isang mata mo Kung isa lang ang mata mo, dapat yung nakakakitang mata ay 0.5 at 150-angle ang vision.  Ano ang procedure ng pagkuha nito? Ihanda mo ang mga kailangan.\n Juuminhyo (kunin mo ito sa city hall) Inkan 3cm x 2.4cm na litrato (kinuha sa loob ng 6 buwan). Libre ang palitrato sa testing center pero kung gusto mo ng magandang (o poging) litrato ay ihanda mo na lang ng sarili mo. Pera (yung 7,800 yen) Ballpen at lapis Salamin, kung kailangan  Punta ka sa testing center.\n Sulatan ang application form, bili ka ng revenue stamp (7,800), pila ka sa information. Aptitude test (tainga at mata) Paper test (30 minutes: 46 na true or false question at 2 situation test (2 points bawat isa). Total 50 points at 45 points ang passing. Announcement ng passers. Kung bumagsak ka, pa-schedule ka ulit!  Kung pumasa ka sa paper test, bibigyan ka ng scooter training course. Malapit na! Pagkatapos ng actual course na mga 2 hanggang 3 oras ay manunood ng video. Pagkatapos nito ay may scooter license ka na!\nMadali lang, di ba? Ang totoo ay 50% lang daw ang passing rate ng scooter license test. Hindi naman daw ganon kahirap ang test, pero dahil dumadami daw ang aksidente ng scooter ay naging mas estrikto kesa sa dati. Isa pa daw na dahilan ay may impression ang marami na madali lang ang test kaya pumupunta sa testing center nang hindi nag-aaral.\nKaramihan ng tanong ay tungkol sa manners sa pagsakay ng scooter at traffic rules, at hindi ito mga tanong na madaling sagutin nang hindi nag-aaral. Kaya mag-aral!\nNga pala maraming tanong sa Internet na puwede mong pagpraktisan, kagaya nito:\nKung gusto mo naman nang mas malalim na kaalaman tungkol sa batas trapiko ng Japan, kailangan mong basahin ang librong ito:\nRules of the Road by Japan Automobile Association\nMay expiration ba ang scooter license?

Neither hunger, nor nakedness, nor inclemency of the weather troubles you. With the payment of seven reals per year, you remain free of contributions. You do not have to close your houses with bolts. You do not fear that the district troopers will come in to lay waste your fields, and trample you under foot at your own firesides. You call ‘father’ the one who is in command over you. Perhaps there will come a time when you will be more civilized, and you will break out in revolution; and you will wake terrified, at the tumult of the riots, and will see blood flowing through these quiet fields, and gallows and guillotines erected in these squares, which never yet have seen an execution.”[6] Thus moralized a Spanish traveler in 1842, just as that dolce far niente was drawing to its close. Already far-seeing men had begun to raise in the Spanish parliament the question of the future of the Philippines, looking toward some definite program for their care under modern conditions and for the adjustment of their relations with the mother country. But these were mere Cassandra-voices—the horologe of time was striking for Rome’s successor, as it did for Rome herself.\nJust where will come the outbreak after three centuries of mind-repression and soul-distortion, of forcing a growing subject into the strait-jacket of medieval thought and action, of natural selection reversed by the constant elimination of native initiative and leadership, is indeed a curious study. That there will be an outbreak somewhere is as certain as that the plant will grow toward the light, even under the most unfavorable conditions, for man’s nature is but the resultant of eternal forces that ceaselessly and irresistibly interplay about and upon him, and somewhere this resultant will express itself in thought or deed.\nAfter three centuries of Spanish ecclesiastical domination in the Philippines, it was to be expected that the wards would turn against their mentors the methods that had been used upon them, nor is it especially remarkable that there was a decided tendency in some parts to revert to primitive barbarism, but that concurrently a creative genius—a bard or seer—should have been developed among a people who, as a whole, have hardly passed through the clan or village stage of society, can be regarded as little less than a psychological phenomenon, and provokes the perhaps presumptuous inquiry as to whether there may not be some things about our common human nature that the learned doctors have not yet included in their anthropometric diagrams.\nOn the western shore of the Lake of Bay in the heart of the Philippines clusters the village of Kalamba, first established by the Jesuit Fathers in the early days of the conquest, and upon their expulsion in 1767 taken over by the Crown, which later transferred it to the Dominicans, under whose care the fertile fields about it became one of the richest of the friar estates. It can hardly be called a town, even for the Philippines, but is rather a market-village, set as it is at the outlet of the rich country of northern Batangas on the open waterway to Manila and the outside world. Around it flourish the green rice-fields, while Mount Makiling towers majestically near in her moods of cloud and sunshine, overlooking the picturesque curve of the shore and the rippling waters of the lake. Shadowy to the eastward gleam the purple crests of Banahao and Cristobal, and but a few miles to the southwestward dim-thundering, seething, earth-rocking Taal mutters and moans of the world’s birth-throes. It is the center of a region rich in native lore and legend, as it sleeps through the dusty noons when the cacao leaves droop with the heat and dreams through the silvery nights, waking twice or thrice a week to the endless babble and ceaseless chatter of an Oriental market where the noisy throngs make of their trading as much a matter of pleasure and recreation as of business.\nDirectly opposite this market-place, in a house facing the village church, there was born in 1861 into the already large family of one of the more prosperous tenants on the Dominican estate a boy who was to combine in his person the finest traits of the Oriental character with the best that Spanish and European culture could add, on whom would fall the burden of his people’s woes to lead him over the via dolorosa of struggle and sacrifice, ending in his own destruction amid the crumbling ruins of the system whose disintegration he himself had done so much to compass.\nJosé Rizal-Mercado y Alonso, as his name emerges from the confusion of Filipino nomenclature, was of Malay extraction, with some distant strains of Spanish and Chinese blood. His genealogy reveals several persons remarkable for intellect and independence of character, notably a Philippine Eloise and Abelard, who, drawn together by their common enthusiasm for study and learning, became his maternal grandparents, as well as a great-uncle who was a traveler and student and who directed the boy’s early studies. Thus from the beginning his training was exceptional, while his mind was stirred by the trouble already brewing in his community, and from the earliest hours of consciousness he saw about him the wrongs and injustices which overgrown power will ever develop in dealing with a weaker subject. One fact of his childhood, too, stands out clearly, well worthy of record: his mother seems to have been a woman of more than ordinary education for the time and place, and, pleased with the boy’s quick intelligence, she taught him to read Spanish from a copy of the Vulgate in that language, which she had somehow managed to secure and keep in her possession—the old, old story of the Woman and the Book, repeated often enough under strange circumstances, but under none stranger than these. The boy’s father was well-to-do, so he was sent at the age of eight to study in the new Jesuit school in Manila, not however before he had already inspired some awe in his simple neighbors by the facility with which he composed verses in his native tongue.\nHe began his studies in a private house while waiting for an opportunity to enter the Ateneo, as the Jesuit school is called, and while there he saw one of his tutors, Padre Burgos, haled to an ignominious death on the garrote as a result of the affair of 1872. This made a deep impression on his childish mind and, in fact, seems to have been one of the principal factors in molding his ideas and shaping his career. That the effect upon him was lasting and that his later judgment confirmed him in the belief that a great injustice had been done, are shown by the fact that his second important work, El Filibusterismo, written about 1891, and miscalled by himself a “novel,” for it is really a series of word-paintings constituting a terrific arraignment of the whole régime, was dedicated to the three priests executed in 1872, in these words: “Religion, in refusing to degrade you, has placed in doubt the crime imputed to you; the government, in surrounding your case with mystery and shadow, gives reason for belief in some error, committed in fatal moments; and all the Philippines, in venerating your memory and calling you martyrs, in no way acknowledges your guilt.” The only answer he ever received to this was eight Remington bullets fired into his back.\nIn the Ateneo he quickly attracted attention and became a general favorite by his application to his studies, the poetic fervor with which he entered into all the exercises of religious devotion, and the gentleness of his character. He was from the first considered “peculiar,” for so the common mind regards everything that fails to fit the old formulas, being of a rather dreamy and reticent disposition, more inclined to reading Spanish romances than joining in the games of his schoolmates. And of all the literatures that could be placed in the hands of an imaginative child, what one would be more productive in a receptive mind of a fervid love of life and home and country and all that men hold dear, than that of the musical language of Castile, with its high coloring and passionate character?\nHis activities were varied, for, in addition to his regular studies, he demonstrated considerable skill in wood-carving and wax-modeling, and during this period won several prizes for poetical compositions in Spanish, which, while sometimes juvenile in form and following closely after Spanish models, reveal at times flashes of thought and turns of expression that show distinct originality; even in these early compositions there is that plaintive undertone, that minor chord of sadness, which pervades all his poems, reaching its fullest measure of pathos in the verses written in his death-cell. He received a bachelor’s degree according to the Spanish system in 1877, but continued advanced studies in agriculture at the Ateneo, at the same time that he was pursuing the course in philosophy in the Dominican University of Santo Tomas, where in 1879 he startled the learned doctors by a reference in a prize poem to the Philippines as his “patria,” fatherland. This political heresy on the part of a native of the islands was given no very serious attention at the time, being looked upon as the vagary of a schoolboy, but again in the following year, by what seems a strange fatality, he stirred the resentment of the friars, especially the Dominicans, by winning over some of their number the first prize in a literary contest celebrated in honor of the author of Don Quixote.\nThe archaic instruction in Santo Tomas soon disgusted him and led to disagreements with the instructors, and he turned to Spain. Plans for his journey and his stay there had to be made with the utmost caution, for it would hardly have fared well with his family had it become known that the son of a tenant on an estate which was a part of the University endowment was studying in Europe. He reached Spanish territory first in Barcelona, the hotbed of radicalism, where he heard a good deal of revolutionary talk, which, however, seems to have made but little impression upon him, for throughout his entire career breadth of thought and strength of character are revealed in his consistent opposition to all forms of violence.\nIn Madrid he pursued the courses in medicine and philosophy, but a fact of even more consequence than his proficiency in his regular work was his persistent study of languages and his omnivorous reading. He was associated with the other Filipinos who were working in a somewhat spectacular way, misdirected rather than led by what may be styled the Spanish liberals, for more considerate treatment of the Philippines. But while he was among them he was not of them, as his studious habits and reticent disposition would hardly have made him a favorite among those who were enjoying the broader and gayer life there. Moreover, he soon advanced far beyond them in thought by realizing that they were beginning at the wrong end of the labor, for even at that time he seems to have caught, by what must almost be looked upon as an inspiration of genius, since there was nothing apparent in his training that would have suggested it, the realization of the fact that hope for his people lay in bettering their condition, that any real benefit must begin with the benighted folk at home, that the introduction of reforms for which they were unprepared would be useless, even dangerous to them. This was not at all the popular idea among his associates and led to serious disagreements with their leaders, for it was the way of toil and sacrifice without any of the excitement and glamour that came from drawing up magnificent plans and sending them back home with appeals for funds to carry on the propaganda—for the most part banquets and entertainments to Spain’s political leaders.\nHis views, as revealed in his purely political writings, may be succinctly stated, for he had that faculty of expression which never leaves any room for doubt as to the meaning. His people had a natural right to grow and to develop, and any obstacles to such growth and development were to be removed. He realized that the masses of his countrymen were sunk deep in poverty and ignorance, cringing and crouching before political authority, crawling and groveling before religious superstition, but to him this was no subject for jest or indifferent neglect—it was a serious condition which should be ameliorated, and hope lay in working into the inert social mass the leaven of conscious individual effort toward the development of a distinctive, responsible personality. He was profoundly appreciative of all the good that Spain had done, but saw in this no inconsistency with the desire that this gratitude might be given cause to be ever on the increase, thereby uniting the Philippines with the mother country by the firm bonds of common ideas and interests, for his earlier writings breathe nothing but admiration, respect, and loyalty for Spain and her more advanced institutions. The issue was clear to him and he tried to keep it so.\nIt was indeed administrative myopia, induced largely by blind greed, which allowed the friar orders to confuse the objections to their repressive system with an attack upon Spanish sovereignty, thereby dragging matters from bad to worse, to engender ill feeling and finally desperation. This narrow, selfish policy had about as much soundness in it as the idea upon which it was based, so often brought forward with what looks very suspiciously like a specious effort to cover mental indolence with a glittering generality, “that the Filipino is only a grown-up child and needs a strong paternal government,” an idea which entirely overlooks the natural fact that when an impressionable subject comes within the influence of a stronger force from a higher civilization he is very likely to remain a child—perhaps a stunted one—as long as he is treated as such. There is about as much sense and justice in such logic as there would be in that of keeping a babe confined in swaddling-bands and then blaming it for not knowing how to walk. No creature will remain a healthy child forever, but, as Spain learned to her bitter cost, will be very prone, as the parent grows decrepit and it begins to feel its strength, to prove a troublesome subject to handle, thereby reversing the natural law suggested by the comparison, and bringing such Sancho-Panza statecraft to flounder at last through as hopeless confusion to as absurd a conclusion as his own island government.\nRizal was not one of those rabid, self-seeking revolutionists who would merely overthrow the government and maintain the old system with themselves in the privileged places of the former rulers, nor is he to be classed among the misguided enthusiasts who by their intemperate demands and immoderate conduct merely strengthen the hands of those in power. He realized fully that the restrictions under which the people had become accustomed to order their lives should be removed gradually as they advanced under suitable guidance and became capable of adjusting themselves to the new and better conditions. They should take all the good offered, from any source, especially that suited to their nature, which they could properly assimilate. No great patience was ever exhibited by him toward those of his countrymen–the most repulsive characters in his stories are such–who would make of themselves mere apes and mimes, decorating themselves with a veneer of questionable alien characteristics, but with no personality or stability of their own, presenting at best a spectacle to make devils laugh and angels weep, lacking even the hothouse product’s virtue of being good to look upon.\nReduced to a definite form, the wish of the more thoughtful in the new generation of Filipino leaders that was growing up was that the Philippine Islands be made a province of Spain with representation in the Cortes and the concomitant freedom of expression and criticism. All that was directly asked was some substantial participation in the management of local affairs, and the curtailment of the arbitrary power of petty officials, especially of the friar curates, who constituted the chief obstacle to the education and development of the people.\nThe friar orders were, however, all-powerful, not only in the Philippines, but also in Madrid, where they were not chary of making use of a part of their wealth to maintain their influence. The efforts of the Filipinos in Spain, while closely watched, do not seem to have been given any very serious attention, for the Spanish authorities no doubt realized that as long as the young men stayed in Madrid writing manifestoes in a language which less than one per cent of their countrymen could read and spending their money on members of the Cortes, there could be little danger of trouble in the Philippines. Moreover, the Spanish ministers themselves appear to have been in sympathy with the more moderate wishes of the Filipinos, a fact indicated by the number of changes ordered from time to time in the Philippine administration, but they were powerless before the strength and local influence of the religious orders. So matters dragged their weary way along until there was an unexpected and startling development, a David-Goliath contest, and certainly no one but a genius could have polished the “smooth stone” that was to smite the giant.\nIt is said that the idea of writing a novel depicting conditions in his native land first came to Rizal from a perusal of Eugene Sue’s The Wandering Jew, while he was a student in Madrid, although the model for the greater part of it is plainly the delectable sketches in Don Quixote, for the author himself possessed in a remarkable degree that Cervantic touch which raises the commonplace, even the mean, into the highest regions of art. Not, however, until he had spent some time in Paris continuing his medical studies, and later in Germany, did anything definite result. But in 1887 Noli Me Tangere was printed in Berlin, in an establishment where the author is said to have worked part of his time as a compositor in order to defray his expenses while he continued his studies. A limited edition was published through the financial aid extended by a Filipino associate, and sent to Hongkong, thence to be surreptitiously introduced into the Philippines.\nNoli Me Tangere (“Touch Me Not”) at the time the work was written had a peculiar fitness as a title. Not only was there an apt suggestion of a comparison with the common flower of that name, but the term is also applied in pathology to a malignant cancer which affects every bone and tissue in the body, and that this latter was in the author’s mind would appear from the dedication and from the summing-up of the Philippine situation in the final conversation between Ibarra and Elias. But in a letter written to a friend in Paris at the time, the author himself says that it was taken from the Gospel scene where the risen Savior appears to the Magdalene, to whom He addresses these words, a scene that has been the subject of several notable paintings.\nIn this connection it is interesting to note what he himself thought of the work, and his frank statement of what he had tried to accomplish, made just as he was publishing it: “Noli Me Tangere, an expression taken from the Gospel of St. Luke,7 means touch me not. The book contains things of which no one up to the present time has spoken, for they are so sensitive that they have never suffered themselves to be touched by any one whomsoever. For my own part, I have attempted to do what no one else has been willing to do: I have dared to answer the calumnies that have for centuries been heaped upon us and our country. I have written of the social condition and the life, of our beliefs, our hopes, our longings, our complaints, and our sorrows; I have unmasked the hypocrisy which, under the cloak of religion, has come among us to impoverish and to brutalize us, I have distinguished the true religion from the false, from the superstition that traffics with the holy word to get money and to make us believe in absurdities for which Catholicism would blush, if ever it knew of them. I have unveiled that which has been hidden behind the deceptive and dazzling words of our governments. I have told our countrymen of our mistakes, our vices, our faults, and our weak complaisance with our miseries there. Where I have found virtue I have spoken of it highly in order to render it homage; and if I have not wept in speaking of our misfortunes, I have laughed over them, for no one would wish to weep with me over our woes, and laughter is ever the best means of concealing sorrow. The deeds that I have related are true and have actually occurred; I can furnish proof of this. My book may have (and it does have) defects from an artistic and esthetic point of view—this I do not deny—but no one can dispute the veracity of the facts presented.”[8]\nBut while the primary purpose and first effect of the work was to crystallize anti-friar sentiment, the author has risen above a mere personal attack, which would give it only a temporary value, and by portraying in so clear and sympathetic a way the life of his people has produced a piece of real literature, of especial interest now as they are being swept into the newer day. Any fool can point out errors and defects, if they are at all apparent, and the persistent searching them out for their own sake is the surest mark of the vulpine mind, but the author has east aside all such petty considerations and, whether consciously or not, has left a work of permanent value to his own people and of interest to all friends of humanity. If ever a fair land has been cursed with the wearisome breed of fault-finders, both indigenous and exotic, that land is the Philippines, so it is indeed refreshing to turn from the dreary waste of carping criticisms, pragmatical “scientific” analyses, and sneering half-truths to a story pulsating with life, presenting the Filipino as a human being, with his virtues and his vices, his loves and hates, his hopes and fears.\nThe publication of Noli Me Tangere suggests the reflection that the story of Achilles’ heel is a myth only in form. The belief that any institution, system, organization, or arrangement has reached an absolute form is about as far as human folly can go. The friar orders looked upon themselves as the sum of human achievement in man-driving and God-persuading, divinely appointed to rule, fixed in their power, far above suspicion. Yet they were obsessed by the sensitive, covert dread of exposure that ever lurks spectrally under pharisaism’s specious robe, so when there appeared this work of a “miserable Indian,” who dared to portray them and the conditions that their control produced exactly as they were—for the indefinable touch by which the author gives an air of unimpeachable veracity to his story is perhaps its greatest artistic merit—the effect upon the mercurial Spanish temperament was, to say the least, electric. The very audacity of the thing left the friars breathless.\nA committee of learned doctors from Santo Tomas, who were appointed to examine the work, unmercifully scored it as attacking everything from the state religion to the integrity of the Spanish dominions, so the circulation of it in the Philippines was, of course, strictly prohibited, which naturally made the demand for it greater. Large sums were paid for single copies, of which, it might be remarked in passing, the author himself received scarcely any part; collections have ever had a curious habit of going astray in the Philippines.\nAlthough the possession of a copy by a Filipino usually meant summary imprisonment or deportation, often with the concomitant confiscation of property for the benefit of some “patriot,” the book was widely read among the leading families and had the desired effect of crystallizing the sentiment against the friars, thus to pave the way for concerted action. At last the idol had been flouted, so all could attack it. Within a year after it had begun to circulate in the Philippines a memorial was presented to the Archbishop by quite a respectable part of the Filipinos in Manila, requesting that the friar orders be expelled from the country, but this resulted only in the deportation of every signer of the petition upon whom the government could lay hands. They were scattered literally to the four corners of the earth: some to the Ladrone Islands, some to Fernando Po off the west coast of Africa, some to Spanish prisons, others to remote parts of the Philippines.\nMeanwhile, the author had returned to the Philippines for a visit to his family, during which time he was constantly attended by an officer of the Civil Guard, detailed ostensibly as a body-guard. All his movements were closely watched, and after a few months the Captain-General “advised” him to leave the country, at the same time requesting a copy of Noli Me Tangere, saying that the excerpts submitted to him by the censor had awakened a desire to read the entire work. Rizal returned to Europe by way of Japan and the United States, which did not seem to make any distinct impression upon him, although it was only a little later that he predicted that when Spain lost control of the Philippines, an eventuality he seemed to consider certain not far in the future, the United States would be a probable successor.[9]\nReturning to Europe, he spent some time in London preparing an edition of Morga’s Sucesos de las Filipinas, a work published in Mexico about 1606 by the principal actor in some of the most stirring scenes of the formative period of the Philippine government. It is a record of prime importance in Philippine history, and the resuscitation of it was no small service to the country. Rizal added notes tending to show that the Filipinos had been possessed of considerable culture and civilization before the Spanish conquest, and he even intimated that they had retrograded rather than advanced under Spanish tutelage. But such an extreme view must be ascribed to patriotic ardor, for Rizal himself, though possessed of that intangible quality commonly known as genius and partly trained in northern Europe, is still in his own personality the strongest refutation of such a contention.\nLater, in Ghent, he published El Filibusterismo, called by him a continuation of Noli Me Tangere, but with which it really has no more connection than that some of the characters reappear and are disposed of.[10] There is almost no connected plot in it and hardly any action, but there is the same incisive character-drawing and clear etching of conditions that characterize the earlier work. It is a maturer effort and a more forceful political argument, hence it lacks the charm and simplicity which assign Noli Me Tangere to a preeminent place in Philippine literature. The light satire of the earlier work is replaced by bitter sarcasm delivered with deliberate intent, for the iron had evidently entered his soul with broadening experience and the realization that justice at the hands of decadent Spain had been an iridescent dream of his youth. Nor had the Spanish authorities in the Philippines been idle; his relatives had been subjected to all the annoyances and irritations of petty persecution, eventually losing the greater part of their property, while some of them suffered deportation.\nIn 1891 he returned to Hongkong to practise medicine, in which profession he had remarkable success, even coming to be looked upon as a wizard by his simple countrymen, among whom circulated wonderful accounts of his magical powers. He was especially skilled in ophthalmology, and his first operation after returning from his studies in Europe was to restore his mother’s sight by removing a cataract from one of her eyes, an achievement which no doubt formed the basis of marvelous tales. But the misfortunes of his people were ever the paramount consideration, so he wrote to the Captain-General requesting permission to remove his numerous relatives to Borneo to establish a colony there, for which purpose liberal concessions had been offered him by the British government. The request was denied, and further stigmatized as an “unpatriotic” attempt to lessen the population of the Philippines, when labor was already scarce. This was the answer he received to a reasonable petition after the homes of his family, including his own birthplace, had been ruthlessly destroyed by military force, while a quarrel over ownership and rents was still pending in the courts. The Captain-General at the time was Valeriano Weyler, the pitiless instrument of the reactionary forces manipulated by the monastic orders, he who was later sent to Cuba to introduce there the repressive measures which had apparently been so efficacious in the Philippines, thus to bring on the interference of the United States to end Spain’s colonial power—all of which induces the reflection that there may still be deluded casuists who doubt the reality of Nemesis.\nWeyler was succeeded by Eulogio Despujols, who made sincere attempts to reform the administration, and was quite popular with the Filipinos. In reply to repeated requests from Rizal to be permitted to return to the Philippines unmolested a passport was finally granted to him and he set out for Manila. For this move on his part, in addition to the natural desire to be among his own people, two special reasons appear: he wished to investigate and stop if possible the unwarranted use of his name in taking up collections that always remained mysteriously unaccounted for, and he was drawn by a ruse deliberately planned and executed in that his mother was several times officiously arrested and hustled about as a common criminal in order to work upon the son’s filial feelings and thus get him back within reach of the Spanish authority, which, as subsequent events and later researches have shown, was the real intention in issuing the passport. Entirely unsuspecting any ulterior motive, however, in a few days after his arrival he convoked a motley gathering of Filipinos of all grades of the population, for he seems to have been only slightly acquainted among his own people and not at all versed in the mazy Walpurgis dance of Philippine politics, and laid before it the constitution for a Liga Filipina (Philippine League), an organization looking toward greater unity among the Filipinos and coöperation for economic progress. This Liga was no doubt the result of his observations in England and Germany, and, despite its questionable form as a secret society for political and economic purposes, was assuredly a step in the right direction, but unfortunately its significance was beyond the comprehension of his countrymen, most of whom saw in it only an opportunity for harassing the Spanish government, for which all were ready enough.\nAll his movements were closely watched, and a few days after his return he was arrested on the charge of having seditious literature in his baggage. The friars were already clamoring for his blood, but Despujols seems to have been more in sympathy with Rizal than with the men whose tool he found himself forced to be. Without trial Rizal was ordered deported to Dapitan, a small settlement on the northern coast of Mindanao. The decree ordering this deportation and the destruction of all copies of his books to be found in the Philippines is a marvel of sophistry, since, in the words of a Spanish writer of the time, “in this document we do not know which to wonder at most: the ingenuousness of the Governor-General, for in this decree he implicitly acknowledges his weakness and proneness to error, or the candor of Rizal, who believed that all the way was strewn with roses.”[11] But it is quite evident that Despujols was playing a double game, of which he seems to have been rather ashamed, for he gave strict orders that copies of the decree should be withheld from Rizal.\nIn Dapitan Rizal gave himself up to his studies and such medical practice as sought him out in that remote spot, for the fame of his skill was widely extended, and he was allowed to live unmolested under parole that he would make no attempt to escape. In company with a Jesuit missionary he gathered about him a number of native boys and conducted a practical school on the German plan, at the same time indulging in religious polemics with his Jesuit acquaintances by correspondence and working fitfully on some compositions which were never completed, noteworthy among them being a study in English of the Tagalog verb.\nBut while he was living thus quietly in Dapitan, events that were to determine his fate were misshaping themselves in Manila. The stone had been loosened on the mountain-side and was bounding on in mad career, far beyond his control.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/translators-introduction-ii/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Kapag malapit na ang expiration ng visa ay kailangang i-renew ito sa malapit na regional immigration office kung magpapatuloy ng paninirahan sa Japan.\nDepende sa visa, karamihan ay ginagawa ito 1 beses sa 1 taon, pero meron ding 1 beses sa 3 taon o 1 beses sa 5 taon.

Only a few days after Rizal was so summarily hustled away, Bonifacio gathered together a crowd of malcontents and ignorant dupes, some of them composing as choice a gang of cutthroats as ever slit the gullet of a Chinese or tied mutilated prisoners in ant hills, and solemnly organized the Kataastaasang Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng̃ mga Anak ng̃ Bayan, “Supreme Select Association of the Sons of the People,” for the extermination of the ruling race and the restoration of the Golden Age. It was to bring the people into concerted action for a general revolt on a fixed date, when they would rise simultaneously, take possession of the city of Manila, and—the rest were better left to the imagination, for they had been reared under the Spanish colonial system and imitativeness has ever been pointed out as a cardinal trait in the Filipino character. No quarter was to be asked or given, and the most sacred ties, even of consanguinity, were to be disregarded in the general slaughter. To the inquiry of a curious neophyte as to how the Spaniards were to be distinguished from the other Europeans, in order to avoid international complications, dark Andres replied that in case of doubt they should proceed with due caution but should take good care that they made no mistakes about letting any of the Castilas escape their vengeance. The higher officials of the government were to be taken alive as hostages, while the friars were to be reserved for a special holocaust on Bagumbayan Field, where over their incinerated remains a heaven-kissing monument would be erected.\nThis Katipunan seems to have been an outgrowth from Spanish freemasonry, introduced into the Philippines by a Spaniard named Morayta and Marcelo H. del Pilar, a native of Bulacan Province who was the practical leader of the Filipinos in Spain, but who died there in 1896 just as he was setting out for Hongkong to mature his plans for a general uprising to expel the friar orders. There had been some masonic societies in the islands for some time, but the membership had been limited to Peninsulars, and they played no part in the politics of the time. But about 1888 Filipinos began to be admitted into some of them, and later, chiefly through the exertions of Pilar, lodges exclusively for them were instituted. These soon began to display great activity, especially in the transcendental matter of collections, so that their existence became a source of care to the government and a nightmare to the religious orders. From them, and with a perversion of the idea in Rizal’s still-born Liga, it was an easy transition to the Katipunan, which was to put aside all pretense of reconciliation with Spain, and at the appointed time rise to exterminate not only the friars but also all the Spaniards and Spanish sympathizers, thus to bring about the reign of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, under the benign guidance of Patriot Bonifacio, with his bolo for a scepter.\nWith its secrecy and mystic forms, its methods of threats and intimidation, the Katipunan spread rapidly, especially among the Tagalogs, the most intransigent of the native peoples, and, it should be noted, the ones in Whose territory the friars were the principal landlords. It was organized on the triangle plan, so that no member might know or communicate with more than three others—the one above him from whom he received his information and instructions and two below to whom he transmitted them. The initiations were conducted with great secrecy and solemnity, calculated to inspire the new members with awe and fear. The initiate, after a series of blood-curdling ordeals to try out his courage and resolution, swore on a human skull a terrific oath to devote his life and energies to the extermination of the white race, regardless of age or sex, and later affixed to it his signature or mark, usually the latter, with his own blood taken from an incision in the left arm or left breast. This was one form of the famous “blood compact,” which, if history reads aright, played so important a part in the assumption of sovereignty over the Philippines by Legazpi in the name of Philip II.\nRizal was made the honorary president of the association, his portrait hung in all the meeting-halls, and the magic of his name used to attract the easily deluded masses, who were in a state of agitated ignorance and growing unrest, ripe for any movement that looked anti-governmental, and especially anti-Spanish. Soon after the organization had been perfected, collections began to be taken up—those collections were never overlooked—for the purpose of chartering a steamer to rescue him from Dapitan and transport him to Singapore, whence he might direct the general uprising, the day and the hour for which were fixed by Bonifacio for August twenty-sixth, 1896, at six o’clock sharp in the evening, since lack of precision in his magnificent programs was never a fault of that bold patriot, his logic being as severe as that of the Filipino policeman who put the flag at half-mast on Good Friday.\nOf all this Rizal himself was, of course, entirely ignorant, until in May, 1896, a Filipino doctor named Pio Valenzuela, a creature of Bonifacio’s, was despatched to Dapitan, taking along a blind man as a pretext for the visit to the famous oculist, to lay the plans before him for his consent and approval. Rizal expostulated with Valenzuela for a time over such a mad and hopeless venture, which would only bring ruin and misery upon the masses, and then is said to have very humanly lost his patience, ending the interview “in so bad a humor and with words so offensive that the deponent, who had gone with the intention of remaining there a month, took the steamer on the following day, for return to Manila.”[12] He reported secretly to Bonifacio, who bestowed several choice Tagalog epithets on Rizal, and charged his envoy to say nothing about the failure of his mission, but rather to give the impression that he had been successful. Rizal’s name continued to be used as the shibboleth of the insurrection, and the masses were made to believe that he would appear as their leader at the appointed hour.\nVague reports from police officers, to the effect that something unusual in the nature of secret societies was going on among the people, began to reach the government, but no great attention was paid to them, until the evening of August nineteenth, when the parish priest of Tondo was informed by the mother-superior of one of the convent-schools that she had just learned of a plot to massacre all the Spaniards. She had the information from a devoted pupil, whose brother was a compositor in the office of the Diario de Manila. As is so frequently the case in Filipino families, this elder sister was the purse-holder, and the brother’s insistent requests for money, which was needed by him to meet the repeated assessments made on the members as the critical hour approached, awakened her curiosity and suspicion to such an extent that she forced him to confide the whole plan to her. Without delay she divulged it to her patroness, who in turn notified the curate of Tondo, where the printing-office was located. The priest called in two officers of the Civil Guard, who arrested the young printer, frightened a confession out of him, and that night, in company with the friar, searched the printing-office, finding secreted there several lithographic plates for printing receipts and certificates of membership in the Katipunan, with a number of documents giving some account of the plot.\nThen the Spanish population went wild. General Ramon Blanco was governor and seems to have been about the only person who kept his head at all. He tried to prevent giving so irresponsible a movement a fictitious importance, but was utterly powerless to stay the clamor for blood which at once arose, loudest on the part of those alleged ministers of the gentle Christ. The gates of the old Walled City, long fallen [xlii]into disuse, were cleaned and put in order, martial law was declared, and wholesale arrests made. Many of the prisoners were confined in Fort Santiago, one batch being crowded into a dungeon for which the only ventilation was a grated opening at the top, and one night a sergeant of the guard carelessly spread his sleeping-mat over this, so the next morning some fifty-five asphyxiated corpses were hauled away. On the twenty-sixth armed insurrection broke out at Caloocan, just north of Manila, from time immemorial the resort of bad characters from all the country round and the center of brigandage, while at San Juan del Monte, on the outskirts of the city, several bloody skirmishes were fought a few days later with the Guardia Civil Veterana, the picked police force.\nBonifacio had been warned of the discovery of his schemes in time to make his escape and flee to the barrio, or village, of Balintawak, a few miles north of Manila, thence to lead the attack on Caloocan and inaugurate the reign of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity in the manner in which Philippine insurrections have generally had a habit of starting—with the murder of Chinese merchants and the pillage of their shops. He had from the first reserved for himself the important office of treasurer in the Katipunan, in addition to being on occasions president and at all times its ruling spirit, so he now established himself as dictator and proceeded to appoint a magnificent staff, most of whom contrived to escape as soon as they were out of reach of his bolo. Yet he drew considerable numbers about him, for this man, though almost entirely unlettered, seems to have been quite a personality among his own people, especially possessed of that gift of oratory in his native tongue to which the Malay is so preeminently susceptible.\nIn Manila a special tribunal was constituted and worked steadily, sometimes through the siesta-hour, for there were times, of which this was one, when even Spanish justice could be swift. Bagumbayan began to be a veritable field of blood, as the old methods of repression were resorted to for the purpose of striking terror into the native population by wholesale executions, nor did the ruling powers realize that the time for such methods had passed. It was a case of sixteenth-century colonial methods fallen into fretful and frantic senility, so in all this wretched business it is doubtful whim to pity the more: the blind stupidity of the fossilized conservatives incontinently throwing an empire away, forfeiting their influence over a people whom they, by temperament and experience, should have been fitted to control and govern; or the potential cruelty of perverted human nature in the dark Frankenstein who would wreak upon the rulers in their decadent days the most hideous of the methods in the system that produced him, as he planned his festive holocaust and carmagnole on the spot where every spark of initiative and leadership among his people, both good and bad, had been summarily and ruthlessly extinguished. There is at least a world of reflection in it for the rulers of men.\nIn the meantime Rizal, wearying of the quiet life in Dapitan and doubtless foreseeing the impending catastrophe, had requested leave to volunteer his services as a physician in the military hospitals of Cuba, of the horrors and sufferings in which he had heard. General Blanco at once gladly acceded to this request and had him brought to Manila, but unfortunately the boat carrying him arrived there a day too late for him to catch the regular August mail-steamer to Spain, so he was kept in the cruiser a prisoner of war, awaiting the next transportation. While he was thus detained, the Katipunan plot was discovered and the rebellion broke out. He was accused of being the head of it, but Blanco gave him a personal letter completely exonerating him from any complicity in the outbreak, as well as a letter of recommendation to the Spanish minister of war. He was placed on the Isla de Panay when it left for Spain on September third and traveled at first as a passenger. At Singapore he was advised to land and claim British protection, as did some of his fellow travelers, but he refused to do so, saying that his conscience was clear.\nAs the name of Rizal had constantly recurred during the trials of the Katipunan suspects, the military tribunal finally issued a formal demand for him. The order of arrest was cabled to Port Said and Rizal there placed in solitary confinement for the remainder of the voyage. Arrived at Barcelona, he was confined in the grim fortress of Montjuich, where; by a curious coincidence, the governor was the same Despujols who had issued the decree of banishment in 1892. Shortly afterwards, he was placed on the transport Colon, which was bound for the Philippines with troops, Blanco having at last been stirred to action. Strenuous efforts were now made by Rizal’s friends in London to have him removed from the ship at Singapore, but the British authorities declined to take any action, on the ground that he was on a Spanish warship and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of their courts. The Colon arrived at Manila on November third and Rizal was imprisoned in Fort Santiago, while a special tribunal was constituted to try him on the charges of carrying on anti-patriotic and anti-religious propaganda, rebellion, sedition, and the formation of illegal associations. Some other charges may have been overlooked in the hurry and excitement.\nIt would be almost a travesty to call a trial the proceedings which began early in December and dragged along until the twenty-sixth. Rizal was defended by a young Spanish officer selected by him from among a number designated by the tribunal, who chivalrously performed so unpopular a duty as well as he could. But the whole affair was a mockery of justice, for the Spanish government in the Philippines had finally and hopelessly reached the condition graphically pictured by Mr. Kipling:\n Panic that shells the drifting spar—\nLoud waste with none to check—\nMad fear that rakes a scornful star\nOr sweeps a consort’s deck!\n The clamor against Blanco had resulted in his summary removal by royal decree and the appointment of a real “pacificator,” Camilo Polavieja.\nWhile in prison Rizal prepared an address to those of his countrymen who were in armed rebellion, repudiating the use of his name and deprecating the resort to violence. The closing words are a compendium of his life and beliefs: “Countrymen: I have given proofs, as well as the best of you, of desiring liberty for our country, and I continue to desire it. But I place as a premise the education of the people, so that by means of instruction and work they may have a personality of their own and that they may make themselves worthy of that same liberty. In my writings I have recommended the study of the civic virtues, without which there can be no redemption. I have also written (and my words have been repeated) that reforms, to be fruitful, must come from above, that those which spring from below are uncertain and insecure movements. Imbued with these ideas, I cannot do less than condemn, and I do condemn, this absurd, savage rebellion, planned behind my back, which dishonors the Filipinos and discredits those who can speak for us. I abominate all criminal actions and refuse any kind of participation in them, pitying with all my heart the dupes who have allowed themselves to be deceived. Go back, then, to your homes, and may God forgive those who have acted in bad faith.” This address, however, was not published by the Spanish authorities, since they did not consider it “patriotic” enough; instead, they killed the writer!\nRizal appeared before the tribunal bound, closely guarded by two Peninsular soldiers, but maintained his serenity throughout and answered the charges in a straightforward way. He pointed out the fact that he had never taken any great part in politics, having even quarreled with Marcelo del Pilar, the active leader of the anti-clericals, by reason of those perennial “subscriptions,” and that during the time he was accused of being the instigator and organizer of armed rebellion he had been a close prisoner in Dapitan under strict surveillance by both the military and ecclesiastical authorities. The prosecutor presented a lengthy document, which ran mostly to words, about the only definite conclusion laid down in it being that the Philippines “are, and always must remain, Spanish territory.” What there may have been in Rizal’s career to hang such a conclusion upon is not quite dear, but at any rate this learned legal light was evidently still thinking in colors on the map serenely unconscious in his European pseudo-prescience of the new and wonderful development in the Western Hemisphere–humanity militant, Lincolnism.\nThe death sentence was asked, but the longer the case dragged on the more favorable it began to look for the accused, so the president of the tribunal, after deciding, Jeffreys-like, that the charges had been proved, ordered that no further evidence be taken. Rizal betrayed some sunrise when his doom was thus foreshadowed, for, dreamer that he was, he seems not to have anticipated such a fatal eventuality for himself. He did not lose his serenity, however, even when the tribunal promptly brought in a verdict of guilty and imposed the death sentence, upon which Polavieja the next day placed his Cúmplase, fixing the morning of December thirtieth for the execution.\nSo Rizal’s fate was sealed. The witnesses against him, in so far as there was any substantial testimony at all, had been his own countrymen, coerced or cajoled into making statements which they have since repudiated as false, and which in some cases were extorted from them by threats and even torture. But he betrayed very little emotion, even maintaining what must have been an assumed cheerfulness. Only one reproach is recorded: that he had been made a dupe of, that he had been deceived by every one, even the bankeros and cocheros. His old Jesuit instructors remained with him in the capilla, or death-cell,[13] and largely through the influence of an image of the Sacred Heart, which he had carved as a schoolboy, it is claimed that a reconciliation with the Church was effected. There has been considerable pragmatical discussion as to what form of retraction from him was necessary, since he had been, after studying in Europe, a frank freethinker, but such futile polemics may safely be left to the learned doctors. That he was reconciled with the Church would seem to be evidenced by the fact that just before the execution he gave legal status as his wife to the woman, a rather remarkable Eurasian adventuress, who had lived with him in Dapitan, and the religious ceremony was the only one then recognized in the islands.14 The greater part of his last night on earth was spent in composing a chain of verse; no very majestic flight of poesy, but a pathetic monody throbbing with patient resignation and inextinguishable hope, one of the sweetest, saddest swan-songs ever sung.\nThus he was left at the last, entirely alone. As soon as his doom became certain the Patriots had all scurried to cover, one gentle poetaster even rushing into doggerel verse to condemn him as a reversion to barbarism; the wealthier suspects betook themselves to other lands or made judicious use of their money-bags among the Spanish officials; the better classes of the population floundered hopelessly, leaderless, in the confused whirl of opinions and passions; while the voiceless millions for whom he had spoken moved on in dumb, uncomprehending silence. He had lived in that higher dreamland of the future, ahead of his countrymen, ahead even of those who assumed to be the mentors of his people, and he must learn, as does every noble soul that labors “to make the bounds of freedom wider yet,” the bitter lesson that nine-tenths, if not all, the woes that afflict humanity spring from man’s own stupid selfishness, that the wresting of the scepter from the tyrant is often the least of the task, that the bondman comes to love his bonds–like Chillon’s prisoner, his very chains and he grow friends,—but that the struggle for human freedom must go on, at whatever cost, in ever-widening circles, “wave after wave, each mightier than the last,” for as long as one body toils in fetters or one mind welters in blind ignorance, either of the slave’s base delusion or the despot’s specious illusion, there can be no final security for any free man, or his children, or his children’s children.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/translators-introduction-iii/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Iba’t-ibang immigration procedure para sa mga Pilipinong nakatira sa Japan.

Bagumbayan Field was crowded with troops, both regulars and militia, for every man capable of being trusted with arms was drawn up there, excepting only the necessary guards in other parts of the city. Extra patrols were in the streets, double guards were placed over the archiepiscopal and gubernatorial palaces. The calmest man in all Manila that day was he who must stand before the firing-squad.\nTwo special and unusual features are to be noted about this execution. All the principal actors were Filipinos: the commander of the troops and the officer directly in charge of the execution were native-born, while the firing-squad itself was drawn from a local native regiment, though it is true that on this occasion a squad of Peninsular cazadores, armed with loaded Mausers, stood directly behind them to see that they failed not in their duty. Again, there was but one victim; for it seems to have ever been the custom of the Spanish rulers to associate in these gruesome affairs some real criminals with the political offenders, no doubt with the intentional purpose of confusing the issue in the general mind. Rizal standing alone, the occasion of so much hurried preparation and fearful precaution, is a pathetic testimonial to the degree of incapacity into which the ruling powers had fallen, even in chicanery.\nAfter bidding good-by to his sister and making final disposition regarding some personal property, the doomed man, under close guard, walked calmly, even cheerfully, from Fort Santiago along the Malecon to the Luneta, accompanied by his Jesuit confessors. Arrived there, he thanked those about him for their kindness and requested the officer in charge to allow him to face the firing-squad, since he had never been a traitor to Spain. This the officer declined to permit, for the order was to shoot him in the back. Rizal assented with a slight protest, pointed out to the soldiers the spot in his back at which they should aim, and with a firm step took his place in front of them.\nThen occurred an act almost too hideous to record. There he stood, expecting a volley of Remington bullets in his back—Time was, and Life’s stream ebbed to Eternity’s flood—when the military surgeon stepped forward and asked if he might feel his pulse! Rizal extended his left hand, and the officer remarked that he could not understand how a man’s pulse could beat normally at such a terrific moment! The victim shrugged his shoulders and let the hand fall again to his side—Latin refinement could be no further refined!\nA moment later there he lay, on his right side, his life-blood spurting over the Luneta curb, eyes wide open, fixedly staring at that Heaven where the priests had taught all those centuries agone that Justice abides. The troops filed past the body, for the most part silently, while desultory cries of “Viva España!” from among the “patriotic” Filipino volunteers were summarily hushed by a Spanish artillery-officer’s stern rebuke: “Silence, you rabble!” To drown out the fitful cheers and the audible murmurs, the bands struck up Spanish national airs. Stranger death-dirge no man and system ever had. Carnival revelers now dance about the scene and Filipino schoolboys play baseball over that same spot.\nA few days later another execution was held on that spot, of members of the Liga, some of them characters that would have richly deserved shooting at any place or time, according to existing standards, but notable among them there knelt, torture-crazed, as to his orisons, Francisco Roxas, millionaire capitalist, who may be regarded as the social and economic head of the Filipino people, as Rizal was fitted to be their intellectual leader. Shades of Anda and Vargas! Out there [l]at Balintawak—rather fitly, “the home of the snake-demon,”—not three hours’ march from this same spot, on the very edge of the city, Andres Bonifacio and his literally sansculottic gangs of cutthroats were, almost with impunity, soiling the fair name of Freedom with murder and mutilation, rape and rapine, awakening the worst passions of an excitable, impulsive people, destroying that essential respect for law and order, which to restore would take a holocaust of fire and blood, with a generation of severe training. Unquestionably did Rizal demonstrate himself to be a seer and prophet when he applied to such a system the story of Babylon and the fateful handwriting on the wall!\nBut forces had been loosed that would not be so suppressed, the time had gone by when such wild methods of repression would serve. The destruction of the native leaders, culminating in the executions of Rizal and Roxas, produced a counter-effect by rousing the Tagalogs, good and bad alike, to desperate fury, and the aftermath was frightful. The better classes were driven to take part in the rebellion, and Cavite especially became a veritable slaughter-pen, as the contest settled down into a hideous struggle for mutual extermination. Dark Andres went his wild way to perish by the violence he had himself invoked, a prey to the rising ambition of a young leader of considerable culture and ability, a schoolmaster named Emilio Aguinaldo. His Katipunan hovered fitfully around Manila, for a time even drawing to itself in their desperation some of the better elements of the population, only to find itself sold out and deserted by its leaders, dying away for a time; but later, under changed conditions, it reappeared in strange metamorphosis as the rallying-center for the largest number of Filipinos who have ever gathered together for a common purpose, and then finally went down before those thin grim lines in khaki with sharp and sharpest shot clearing away the wreck of the old, blazing the way for the new: the broadening sweep of “Democracy announcing, in rifle-volleys death-winged, under her Star Banner, to the tune of Yankee-doodle-do, that she is born, and, whirlwind-like, will envelop the whole world!”\nMANILA, December 1, 1909\n1 Quoted by Macaulay: Essay on the Succession in Spain.\n2 The ruins of the Fuerza de Playa Honda, ó Real de Paynavén, are still to be seen in the present municipality of Botolan, Zambales.

He wrote a history of the conquest, and in 1800 accompanied Alava, the General de Marina, on his tours of investigation looking toward preparations for the defense of the islands against another attack of the British, with whom war threatened. The Estadismo, which is a record of these journeys, with some account of the rest of the islands, remained in manuscript until 1893, when it was published in Madrid.\n5 Secular, as distinguished from the regulars, i.e., members of the monastic orders.\n6 Sinibaldo de Mas, Informe sobre el estado de las Islas Filipinas en 1842, translated in Blair and Robertson’s The Philippine Islands, Vol. XXVIII, p. 254.\n7 Sic.

Retana, in the appendix to Fray Martinez de Zuñiga’s Estadismo, Madrid, 1893, where the decree is quoted. The rest of this comment of Retana’s deserves quotation as an estimate of the living man by a Spanish publicist who was at the time in the employ of the friars and contemptuously hostile to Rizal, but who has since 1898 been giving quite a spectacular demonstration of waving a red light after the wreck, having become his most enthusiastic, almost hysterical, biographer: “Rizal is what is commonly called a character, but he has repeatedly demonstrated very great inexperience in the affairs of life. I believe him to be now about thirty-two years old. He is the Indian of most ability among those who have written.”\n12 From Valenzuela’s deposition before the military tribunal, September sixth, 1896.\n13 Capilla: the Spanish practise is to place a condemned person for the twenty-four hours preceding his execution in a chapel, or a cell fitted up as such, where he may devote himself to religious exercises and receive the final ministrations of the Church.\n14 But even this conclusion is open to doubt: there is no proof beyond the unsupported statement of the Jesuits that he made a written retraction, which was later destroyed, though why a document so interesting, and so important in support of their own point of view, should not have been preserved furnishes an illuminating commentary on the whole confused affair. The only unofficial witness present was the condemned man’s sister, and her declaration, that she was at the time in such a state of excitement and distress that she is unable to affirm positively that there was a real marriage ceremony performed, can readily be accepted. It must be remembered that the Jesuits were themselves under the official and popular ban for the part they had played in Rizal’s education and development and that they were seeking to set themselves right in order to maintain their prestige. Add to this the persistent and systematic effort made to destroy every scrap of record relating to the man—the sole gleam of shame evidenced in the impolitic, idiotic, and pusillanimous treatment of him—and the whole question becomes such a puzzle that it may just as well be left in darkness, with a throb of pity for the unfortunate victim caught in such a maelstrom of panic-stricken passion and selfish intrigue.\n What?

In spite of the fact that, contrary to his usual custom, he had made the announcement only that afternoon, it was already the sole topic of conversation in Binondo and adjacent districts, and even in the Walled City, for at that time Capitan Tiago was considered one of the most hospitable of men, and it was well known that his house, like his country, shut its doors against nothing except commerce and all new or bold ideas. Like an electric shock the announcement ran through the world of parasites, bores, and hangers-on, whom God in His infinite bounty creates and so kindly multiplies in Manila. Some looked at once for shoe-polish, others for buttons and cravats, but all were especially concerned about how to greet the master of the house in the most familiar tone, in order to create an atmosphere of ancient friendship or, if occasion should arise, to excuse a late arrival.\nThis dinner was given in a house on Calle Anloague, and although we do not remember the number we will describe it in such a way that it may still be recognized, provided the earthquakes have not destroyed it. We do not believe that its owner has had it torn down, for such labors are generally entrusted to God or nature—which Powers hold the contracts also for many of the projects of our government. It [2]is a rather large building, in the style of many in the country, and fronts upon the arm of the Pasig which is known to some as the Binondo River, and which, like all the streams in Manila, plays the varied rôles of bath, sewer, laundry, fishery, means of transportation and communication, and even drinking water if the Chinese water-carrier finds it convenient. It is worthy of note that in the distance of nearly a mile this important artery of the district, where traffic is most dense and movement most deafening, can boast of only one wooden bridge, which is out of repair on one side for six months and impassable on the other for the rest of the year, so that during the hot season the ponies take advantage of this permanent status quo to jump off the bridge into the water, to the great surprise of the abstracted mortal who may be dozing inside the carriage or philosophizing upon the progress of the age.\nThe house of which we are speaking is somewhat low and not exactly correct in all its lines: whether the architect who built it was afflicted with poor eyesight or whether the earthquakes and typhoons have twisted it out of shape, no one can say with certainty. A wide staircase with green newels and carpeted steps leads from the tiled entrance up to the main floor between rows of flower-pots set upon pedestals of motley-colored and fantastically decorated Chinese porcelain. Since there are neither porters nor servants who demand invitation cards, we will go in, O you who read this, whether friend or foe, if you are attracted by the strains of the orchestra, the lights, or the suggestive rattling of dishes, knives, and forks, and if you wish to see what such a gathering is like in the distant Pearl of the Orient. Gladly, and for my own comfort, I should spare you this description of the house, were it not of great importance, since we mortals in general are very much like tortoises: we are esteemed and classified according to our shells; in this and still other respects the mortals of the Philippines in particular also resemble tortoises.\nIf we go up the stairs, we immediately find ourselves in a spacious hallway, called there, for some unknown reason, the caida, which tonight serves as the dining-room and at the same time affords a place for the orchestra. In the center a large table profusely and expensively decorated seems to beckon to the hanger-on with sweet promises, while it threatens the bashful maiden, the simple dalaga, with two mortal hours in the company of strangers whose language and conversation usually have a very restricted and special character.\nContrasted with these terrestrial preparations are the motley paintings on the walls representing religious matters, such as “Purgatory,” “Hell,” “The Last Judgment,” “The Death of the Just,” and “The Death of the Sinner.”\nAt the back of the room, fastened in a splendid and elegant framework, in the Renaissance style, possibly by Arévalo, is a glass case in which are seen the figures of two old women. The inscription on this reads: “Our Lady of Peace and Prosperous Voyages, who is worshiped in Antipolo, visiting in the disguise of a beggar the holy and renowned Capitana Inez during her sickness.”[1] While the work reveals little taste or art, yet it possesses in compensation an extreme realism, for to judge from the yellow and bluish tints of her face the sick woman seems to be already a decaying corpse, and the glasses and other objects, accompaniments of long illness, are so minutely reproduced that even their contents may be distinguished. In looking at these pictures, which excite the appetite and inspire gay bucolic ideas, one may perhaps be led to think that the malicious host is well acquainted with the characters of the majority of those who are to sit at his table and that, in order to conceal his own way of thinking, he has hung from the ceiling costly Chinese lanterns; bird-cages without birds; red, green, and blue globes of frosted glass; faded air-plants; and dried and inflated fishes, which they call botetes. The view is closed on the side of the river by curious wooden arches, half Chinese and half European, affording glimpses of a terrace with arbors and bowers faintly lighted by paper lanterns of many colors.\nIn the sala, among massive mirrors and gleaming chandeliers, the guests are assembled. Here, on a raised platform, stands a grand piano of great price, which tonight has the additional virtue of not being played upon. Here, hanging on the wall, is an oil-painting of a handsome man in full dress, rigid, erect, straight as the tasseled cane he holds in his stiff, ring-covered fingers—the whole seeming to say, “Ahem! See how well dressed and how dignified I am!” The furnishings of the room are elegant and perhaps uncomfortable and unhealthful, since the master of the house would consider not so much the comfort and health of his guests as his own ostentation, “A terrible thing is dysentery,” he would say to them, “but you are sitting in European chairs and that is something you don’t find every day.”\nThis room is almost filled with people, the men being separated from the women as in synagogues and Catholic churches. The women consist of a number of Filipino and Spanish maidens, who, when they open their mouths to yawn, instantly cover them with their fans and who murmur only a few words to each other, any conversation ventured upon dying out in monosyllables like the sounds heard in a house at night, sounds made by the rats and lizards. Is it perhaps the different likenesses of Our Lady hanging on the walls that force them to silence and a religious demeanor or is it that the women here are an exception?\nA cousin of Capitan Tiago, a sweet-faced old woman, who speaks Spanish quite badly, is the only one receiving the ladies. To offer to the Spanish ladies a plate of cigars and buyos, to extend her hand to her countrywomen to be kissed, exactly as the friars do,—this is the sum of her courtesy, her policy. The poor old lady soon became bored, and taking advantage of the noise of a plate breaking, rushed precipitately away, muttering, “Jesús! Just wait, you rascals!” and failed to reappear.\nThe men, for their part, are making more of a stir. Some cadets in one corner are conversing in a lively manner but in low tones, looking around now and then to point out different persons in the room while they laugh more or less openly among themselves. In contrast, two foreigners dressed in white are promenading silently from one end of the room to the other with their hands crossed behind their backs, like the bored passengers on the deck of a ship. All the interest and the greatest animation proceed from a group composed of two priests, two civilians, and a soldier who are seated around a small table on which are seen bottles of wine and English biscuits.\nThe soldier, a tall, elderly lieutenant with an austere countenance—a Duke of Alva straggling behind in the roster of the Civil Guard—talks little, but in a harsh, curt way. One of the priests, a youthful Dominican friar, handsome, graceful, polished as the gold-mounted eyeglasses he wears, maintains a premature gravity. He is the curate of Binondo and has been in former years a professor in the college of San Juan de Letran,[2] where he enjoyed the reputation of being a consummate dialectician, so much so that in the days when the sons of Guzman[3] still dared to match themselves in subtleties with laymen, the able disputant B. de Luna had never been able either to catch or to confuse him, the distinctions made by Fray Sibyla leaving his opponent in the situation of a fisherman who tries to catch eels with a lasso. The Dominican says little, appearing to weigh his words.\nQuite in contrast, the other priest, a Franciscan, talks much and gesticulates more. In spite of the fact that his hair is beginning to turn gray, he seems to be preserving [6]well his robust constitution, while his regular features, his rather disquieting glance, his wide jaws and herculean frame give him the appearance of a Roman noble in disguise and make us involuntarily recall one of those three monks of whom Heine tells in his “Gods in Exile,” who at the September equinox in the Tyrol used to cross a lake at midnight and each time place in the hand of the poor boatman a silver piece, cold as ice, which left him full of terror.[4] But Fray Damaso is not so mysterious as they were. He is full of merriment, and if the tone of his voice is rough like that of a man who has never had occasion to correct himself and who believes that whatever he says is holy and above improvement, still his frank, merry laugh wipes out this disagreeable impression and even obliges us to pardon his showing to the room bare feet and hairy legs that would make the fortune of a Mendieta in the Quiapo fairs.[5]\nOne of the civilians is a very small man with a black beard, the only thing notable about him being his nose, which, to judge from its size, ought not to belong to him. The other is a rubicund youth, who seems to have arrived but recently in the country. With him the Franciscan is carrying on a lively discussion.\n“You’ll see,” the friar was saying, “when you’ve been here a few months you’ll be convinced of what I say. It’s one thing to govern in Madrid and another to live in the Philippines.”\n“But—”\n“I, for example,” continued Fray Damaso, raising his voice still higher to prevent the other from speaking, “I, for example, who can look back over twenty-three years of bananas and morisqueta, know whereof I speak. Don’t come at me with theories and fine speeches, for I know the Indian.[6] Mark well that the moment I arrived in the country I was assigned to a toxin, small it is true, but especially devoted to agriculture. I didn’t understand Tagalog very well then, but I was, soon confessing the women, and we understood one another and they came to like me so well that three years later, when I was transferred to another and larger town, made vacant by the death of the native curate, all fell to weeping, they heaped gifts upon me, they escorted me with music—”\n“But that only goes to show—”\n“Wait, wait! Don’t be so hasty! My successor remained a shorter time, and when he left he had more attendance, more tears, and more music. Yet he had been more given to whipping and had raised the fees in the parish to almost double.”\n“But you will allow me—”\n“But that isn’t all. I stayed in the town of San Diego twenty years and it has been only a few months since I left it.”\nHere he showed signs of chagrin.\n“Twenty years, no one can deny, are more than sufficient to get acquainted with a town. San Diego has a population of six thousand souls and I knew every inhabitant as well as if I had been his mother and wet-nurse. I knew in which foot this one was lame, where the shoe pinched that one, who was courting that girl, what affairs she had had and with whom, who was the real father of the child, and so on—for I was the confessor of every last one, and they took care not to fail in their duty. Our host, Santiago, will tell you whether I am speaking the truth, for he has a lot of land there and that was where we first became friends. Well then, you may see what the Indian is: when I left I was escorted by only a few old women and some of the tertiary brethren—and that after I had been there twenty years!”\n“But I don’t see what that has to do with the abolition of the tobacco monopoly,”7 ventured the rubicund youth, taking advantage of the Franciscan’s pausing to drink a glass of sherry.\nFray Damaso was so greatly surprised that he nearly let his glass fall. He remained for a moment staring fixedly at the young man.\n“What? How’s that?” he was finally able to exclaim in great wonderment. “Is it possible that you don’t see it as clear as day? Don’t you see, my son, that all this proves plainly that the reforms of the ministers are irrational?”\nIt was now the youth’s turn to look perplexed. The lieutenant wrinkled his eyebrows a little more and the small man nodded toward Fray Damaso equivocally. The Dominican contented himself with almost turning his back on the whole group.\n“Do you really believe so?” the young man at length asked with great seriousness, as he looked at the friar with curiosity.\n“Do I believe so? As I believe the Gospel! The Indian is so indolent!”\n“Ah, pardon me for interrupting you,” said the young man, lowering his voice and drawing his chair a little closer, “but you have said something that awakens all my interest. Does this indolence actually, naturally, exist among the natives or is there some truth in what a foreign traveler says: that with this indolence we excuse our own, as well as our backwardness and our colonial system. He referred to other colonies whose inhabitants belong to the same race—”\n[9]“Bah, jealousy! Ask Señor Laruja, who also knows this country. Ask him if there is any equal to the ignorance and indolence of the Indian.”\n“It’s true,” affirmed the little man, who was referred to as Señor Laruja. “In no part of the world can you find any one more indolent than the Indian, in no part of the world.”\n“Nor more vicious, nor more ungrateful!”\n“Nor more unmannerly!”\nThe rubicund youth began to glance about nervously. “Gentlemen,” he whispered, “I believe that we are in the house of an Indian. Those young ladies—”\n“Bah, don’t be so apprehensive! Santiago doesn’t consider himself an Indian—and besides, he’s not here. And what if he were! These are the nonsensical ideas of the newcomers. Let a few months pass and you will change your opinion, after you have attended a lot of fiestas and bailúhan, slept on cots, and eaten your fill of tinola.”\n“Ah, is this thing that you call tinola a variety of lotus which makes people—er—forgetful?”\n“Nothing of the kind!” exclaimed Fray Damaso with a smile. “You’re getting absurd. Tinola is a stew of chicken and squash. How long has it been since you got here?”\n“Four days,” responded the youth, rather offended.\n“Have you come as a government employee?”\n“No, sir, I’ve come at my own expense to study the country.”\n“Man, what a rare bird!” exclaimed Fray Damaso, staring at him with curiosity. “To come at one’s own expense and for such foolishness! What a wonder! When there are so many books! And with two fingerbreadths of forehead! Many have written books as big as that! With two fingerbreadths of forehead!”\nThe Dominican here brusquely broke in upon the conversation. “Did your Reverence, Fray Damaso, say that [10]you had been twenty years in the town of San Diego and that you had left it? Wasn’t your Reverence satisfied with the town?”\nAt this question, which was put in a very natural and almost negligent tone, Fray Damaso suddenly lost all his merriment and stopped laughing. “No!” he grunted dryly, and let himself back heavily against the back of his chair.\nThe Dominican went on in a still more indifferent tone. “It must be painful to leave a town where one has been for twenty years and which he knows as well as the clothes he wears. I certainly was sorry to leave Kamiling and that after I had been there only a few months. But my superiors did it for the good of the Orders for my own good.”\nFray Damaso, for the first time that evening, seemed to be very thoughtful. Suddenly he brought his fist down on the arm of his chair and with a heavy breath exclaimed: “Either Religion is a fact or it is not! That is, either the curates are free or they are not! The country is going to ruin, it is lost!” And again he struck the arm of his chair.\nEverybody in the sala turned toward the group with astonished looks. The Dominican raised his head to stare at the Franciscan from under his glasses. The two foreigners paused a moment, stared with an expression of mingled severity and reproof, then immediately continued their promenade.\n“He’s in a bad humor because you haven’t treated him with deference,” murmured Señor Laruja into the ear of the rubicund youth.\n“What does your Reverence mean? What’s the trouble?” inquired the Dominican and the lieutenant at the same time, but in different tones.\n“That’s why so many calamities come! The ruling powers support heretics against the ministers of God!” continued the Franciscan, raising his heavy fists.\n[11]“What do you mean?” again inquired the frowning lieutenant, half rising from his chair.\n“What do I mean?” repeated Fray Damaso, raising his voice and facing the lieutenant. “I’ll tell you what I mean. I, yes I, mean to say that when a priest throws out of his cemetery the corpse of a heretic, no one, not even the King himself, has any right to interfere and much less to impose any punishment! But a little General—a little General Calamity—”\n“Padre, his Excellency is the Vice-Regal Patron!” shouted the soldier, rising to his feet.\n“Excellency! Vice-Regal Patron! What of that!” retorted the Franciscan, also rising. “In other times he would have been dragged down a staircase as the religious orders once did with the impious Governor Bustamente.8 Those were indeed the days of faith.”\n“I warn you that I can’t permit this! His Excellency represents his Majesty the King!”\n“King or rook! What difference does that make? For us there is no king other than the legitimate9—”\n“Halt!” shouted the lieutenant in a threatening tone, as if he were commanding his soldiers. “Either you withdraw what you have said or tomorrow I will report it to his Excellency!”\n“Go ahead—right now—go on!” was the sarcastic [12]rejoinder of Fray Damaso as he approached the officer with clenched fists. “Do you think that because I wear the cloth, I’m afraid? Go now, while I can lend you my carriage!”\nThe dispute was taking a ludicrous turn, but fortunately the Dominican intervened. “Gentlemen,” he began in an authoritative tone and with the nasal twang that so well becomes the friars, “you must not confuse things or seek for offenses where there are none. We must distinguish in the words of Fray Damaso those of the man from those of the priest. The latter, as such, per se, can never give offense, because they spring from absolute truth, while in those of the man there is a secondary distinction to be made: those which he utters ab irato, those which he utters ex ore, but not in corde, and those which he does utter in corde. These last are the only ones that can really offend, and only according to whether they preexisted as a motive in mente, or arose solely per accidens in the heat of the discussion, if there really exist—”\n“But I, by accidens and for my own part, understand his motives, Padre Sibyla,” broke in the old soldier, who saw himself about to be entangled in so many distinctions that he feared lest he might still be held to blame. “I understand the motives about which your Reverence is going to make distinctions. During the absence of Padre Damaso from San Diego, his coadjutor buried the body of an extremely worthy individual—yes, sir, extremely worthy, for I had had dealings with him many times and had been entertained in his house. What if he never went to confession, what does that matter? Neither do I go to confession! But to say that he committed suicide is a lie, a slander! A man such as he was, who has a son upon whom he centers his affection and hopes, a man who has faith in God, who recognizes his duties to society, a just and honorable man, does not commit suicide. This much I will say and will refrain from expressing the rest of my thoughts here, so please your Reverence.”\n[13]Then, turning his back on the Franciscan, he went on: “Now then, this priest on his return to the town, after maltreating the poor coadjutor, had the corpse dug up and taken away from the cemetery to be buried I don’t know where. The people of San Diego were cowardly enough not to protest, although it is true that few knew of the outrage. The dead man had no relatives there and his only son was in Europe. But his Excellency learned of the affair and as he is an upright man asked for some punishment—and Padre Damaso was transferred to a better town. That’s all there is to it. Now your Reverence can make your distinctions.”\nSo saying, he withdrew from the group.\n“I’m sorry that I inadvertently brought up so delicate a subject,” said Padre Sibyla sadly. “But, after all, if there has been a gain in the change of towns—”\n“How is there to be a gain? And what of all the things that are lost in moving, the letters, and the—and everything that is mislaid?” interrupted Fray Damaso, stammering in the vain effort to control his anger.\nLittle by little the party resumed its former tranquillity. Other guests had come in, among them a lame old Spaniard of mild and inoffensive aspect leaning on the arm of an elderly Filipina, who was resplendent in frizzes and paint and a European gown. The group welcomed them heartily, and Doctor De Espadaña and his señora, the Doctora Doña Victorina, took their seats among our acquaintances. Some newspaper reporters and shopkeepers greeted one another and moved about aimlessly without knowing just what to do.\n“But can you tell me, Señor Laruja, what kind of man our host is?” inquired the rubicund youth. “I haven’t been introduced to him yet.”\n“They say that he has gone out. I haven’t seen him either.”\n“There’s no need of introductions here,” volunteered Fray Damaso. “Santiago is made of the right stuff.”\n“No, he’s not the man who invented gunpowder,”[10] added Laruja.\n“You too, Señor Laruja,” exclaimed Doña Victorina in mild reproach, as she fanned herself. “How could the poor man invent gunpowder if, as is said, the Chinese invented it centuries ago?”\n“The Chinese! Are you crazy?” cried Fray Damaso. “Out with you! A Franciscan, one of my Order, Fray What-do-you-call-him Savalls,[11] invented it in the—ah the seventh century!”\n“A Franciscan? Well, he must have been a missionary in China, that Padre Savalls,” replied the lady, who did not thus easily part from her beliefs.\n“Schwartz,[12] perhaps you mean, señora,” said Fray Sibyla, without looking at her.\n“I don’t know. Fray Damaso said a Franciscan and I was only repeating.”\n“Well, Savalls or Chevas, what does it matter? The difference of a letter doesn’t make him a Chinaman,” replied the Franciscan in bad humor.\n“And in the fourteenth century, not the seventh,” added the Dominican in a tone of correction, as if to mortify the pride of the other friar.\n“Well, neither does a century more or less make him a Dominican.”\n“Don’t get angry, your Reverence,” admonished Padre Sibyla, smiling. “So much the better that he did invent it so as to save his brethren the trouble.”\n“And did you say, Padre Sibyla, that it was in the fourteenth century?” asked Doña Victorina with great interest. “Was that before or after Christ?”\nFortunately for the individual questioned, two persons entered the room.\n 1 A similar picture is found in the convento at Antipolo.—Author’s note.\n2 A school of secondary instruction conducted by the Dominican Fathers, by whom it was taken over in 1640. “It had its first beginning in the house of a pious Spaniard, called Juan Geronimo Guerrero, who had dedicated himself, with Christian piety, to gathering orphan boys in his house, where he raised, clothed, and sustained them, and taught them to read and to write, and much more, to live in the fear of God.”—Blair and Robertson, The Philippine Islands, Vol. XLV, p. 208.—TR.\n3 The Dominican friars, whose order was founded by Dominic de Guzman.—TR.\n4 In the story mentioned, the three monks were the old Roman god Bacchus and two of his satellites, in the disguise of Franciscan friars,—TR.\n5 According to a note to the Barcelona edition of this novel, Mendieta was a character well known in Manila, doorkeeper at the Alcaldía, impresario of children’s theaters, director of a merry-go-round, etc.—TR.\n6 See Glossary.\n7 The “tobacco monopoly” was established during the administration of Basco de Vargas (1778–1787), one of the ablest governors Spain sent to the Philippines, in order to provide revenue for the local government and to encourage agricultural development. The operation of the monopoly, however, soon degenerated into a system of “graft” and petty abuse which bore heartily upon the natives (see Zuñiga’s Estadismo), and the abolition of it in 1881 was one of the heroic efforts made by the Spanish civil administrators to adjust the archaic colonial system to the changing conditions in the Archipelago.—TR.\n8 As a result of his severity in enforcing the payment of sums due the royal treasury on account of the galleon trade, in which the religious orders were heavily interested, Governor Fernando de Bustillos Bustamente y Rueda met a violent death at the hands of a mob headed by friars, October 11, 1719. See Blair and Robertson, The Philippine Islands, Vol. XLIV; Montero y Vidal, Historia General de Filipinas, Vol. I, Chap. XXXV.—TR.\n9 A reference to the fact that the clerical party in Spain refused to accept the decree of Ferdinand VII setting aside the Salic law and naming his daughter Isabella as his successor, and, upon the death of Ferdinand, supported the claim of the nearest male heir, Don Carlos de Bourbon, thus giving rise to the Carlist movement. Some writers state that severe measures had to be adopted to compel many of the friars in the Philippines to use the feminine pronoun in their prayers for the sovereign, just whom the reverend gentlemen expected to deceive not being explained.—TR.\n10 An apothegm equivalent to the English, “He’ll never set any rivers on fire.”—TR.\n11 The name of a Carlist leader in Spain.—TR.\n12 A German Franciscan monk who is said to have invented gunpowder about 1330.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-i-a-social-gathering/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter II – Crisostomo Ibarra It was not two beautiful and well-gowned young women that attracted the attention of all, even including Fray Sibyla, nor was it his Excellency the Captain-General with his staff, that the lieutenant should start from his abstraction and take a couple of steps forward, or that Fray Damaso should look as if turned to stone; it was simply the original of the oil-painting leading by the hand a young man dressed in deep mourning.\n“Good evening, gentlemen! Good evening, Padre!” were the greetings of Capitan Tiago as he kissed the hands of the priests, who forgot to bestow upon him their benediction. The Dominican had taken off his glasses to stare at the newly arrived youth, while Fray Damaso was pale and unnaturally wide-eyed.\n“I have the honor of presenting to you Don Crisostomo Ibarra, the son of my deceased friend,” went on Capitan Tiago. “The young gentleman has just arrived from Europe and I went to meet him.”\nAt the mention of the name exclamations were heard. The lieutenant forgot to pay his respects to his host and approached the young man, looking him over from head to foot. The young man himself at that moment was exchanging the conventional greetings with all in the group, nor did there seem to be any thing extraordinary about him except his mourning garments in the center of that brilliantly lighted room. Yet in spite of them his remarkable stature, his features, and his movements breathed forth an air of healthy youthfulness in which both body and mind had equally developed. There might have been noticed in his frank, pleasant face some faint traces of Spanish blood showing through a beautiful brown color, slightly flushed at the cheeks as a result perhaps of his residence in cold countries.\n“What!” he exclaimed with joyful surprise, “the curate of my native town! Padre Damaso, my father’s intimate friend!”\nEvery look in the room was directed toward the Franciscan, who made no movement.\n“Pardon me, perhaps I’m mistaken,” added Ibarra, embarrassed.\n“You are not mistaken,” the friar was at last able to articulate in a changed voice, “but your father was never an intimate friend of mine.”\nIbarra slowly withdrew his extended hand, looking greatly surprised, and turned to encounter the gloomy gaze of the lieutenant fixed on him.\n“Young man, are you the son of Don Rafael Ibarra?” he asked.\nThe youth bowed. Fray Damaso partly rose in his chair and stared fixedly at the lieutenant.\n“Welcome back to your country! And may you be happier in it than your father was!” exclaimed the officer in a trembling voice. “I knew him well and can say that he was one of the worthiest and most honorable men in the Philippines.”\n“Sir,” replied Ibarra, deeply moved, “the praise you bestow upon my father removes my doubts about the manner of his death, of which I, his son, am yet ignorant.”\nThe eyes of the old soldier filled with tears and turning away hastily he withdrew. The young man thus found himself alone in the center of the room. His host having disappeared, he saw no one who might introduce him to the young ladies, many of whom were watching him with interest. After a few moments of hesitation he started toward them in a simple and natural manner.\n“Allow me,” he said, “to overstep the rules of strict etiquette. It has been seven years since I have been in my own country and upon returning to it I cannot suppress my admiration and refrain from paying my respects to its most precious ornaments, the ladies.”\nBut as none of them ventured a reply, he found himself obliged to retire. He then turned toward a group of men who, upon seeing him approach, arranged themselves in a semicircle.\n“Gentlemen,” he addressed them, “it is a custom in Germany, when a stranger finds himself at a function and there is no one to introduce him to those present, that he give his name and so introduce himself. Allow me to adopt this usage here, not to introduce foreign customs when our own are so beautiful, but because I find myself driven to it by necessity. I have already paid my respects to the skies and to the ladies of my native land; now I wish to greet its citizens, my fellow-countrymen. Gentlemen, my name is Juan Crisostomo Ibarra y Magsalin.”\nThe others gave their names, more or less obscure, and unimportant here.\n“My name is A———,” said one youth dryly, as he made a slight bow.\n“Then I have the honor of addressing the poet whose works have done so much to keep up my enthusiasm for my native land. It is said that you do not write any more, but I could not learn the reason.”\n“The reason? Because one does not seek inspiration in order to debase himself and lie. One writer has been imprisoned for having put a very obvious truth into verse. They may have called me a poet but they sha’n’t call me a fool.”\n“And may I enquire what that truth was?”\n“He said that the lion’s son is also a lion. He came very near to being exiled for it,” replied the strange youth, moving away from the group.\nA man with a smiling face, dressed in the fashion of the natives of the country, with diamond studs in his shirt-bosom, came up at that moment almost running. He went directly to Ibarra and grasped his hand, saying, “Señor Ibarra, I’ve been eager to make your acquaintance. Capitan Tiago is a friend of mine and I knew your respected father. I am known as Capitan Tinong and live in Tondo, where you will always be welcome. I hope that you will honor me with a visit. Come and dine with us tomorrow.” He smiled and rubbed his hands.\n“Thank you,” replied Ibarra, warmly, charmed with such amiability, “but tomorrow morning I must leave for San Diego.”\n“How unfortunate! Then it will be on your return.”\n“Dinner is served!” announced a waiter from the café La Campana, and the guests began to file out toward the table, the women, especially the Filipinas, with great hesitation.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-ii-crisostomo-ibarra/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter III – The Dinner  Jele, jele, bago quiere.[1]\n Fray Sibyla seemed to be very content as he moved along tranquilly with the look of disdain no longer playing about his thin, refined lips. He even condescended to speak to the lame doctor, De Espadaña, who answered in monosyllables only, as he was somewhat of a stutterer. The Franciscan was in a frightful humor, kicking at the chairs and even elbowing a cadet out of his way. The lieutenant was grave while the others talked vivaciously, praising the magnificence of the table. Doña Victorina, however, was just turning up her nose in disdain when she suddenly became as furious as a trampled serpent—the lieutenant had stepped on the train of her gown.\n“Haven’t you any eyes?” she demanded.\n“Yes, señora, two better than yours, but the fact is that I was admiring your frizzes,” retorted the rather ungallant soldier as he moved away from her.\nAs if from instinct the two friars both started toward the head of the table, perhaps from habit, and then, as might have been expected, the same thing happened that occurs with the competitors for a university position, who openly exalt the qualifications and superiority of their opponents, later giving to understand that just the contrary was meant, and who murmur and grumble when they do not receive the appointment.\n“For you, Fray Damaso.”\n“For you, Fray Sibyla.”\n“An older friend of the family—confessor of the deceased lady—age, dignity, and authority—”\n“Not so very old, either! On the other hand, you are the curate of the district,” replied Fray Damaso sourly, without taking his hand from the back of the chair.\n“Since you command it, I obey,” concluded Fray Sibyla, disposing himself to take the seat.\n“I don’t command it!” protested the Franciscan. “I don’t command it!”\nFray Sibyla was about to seat himself without paying any more attention to these protests when his eyes happened to encounter those of the lieutenant. According to clerical opinion in the Philippines, the highest secular official is inferior to a friar-cook: cedant arma togae, said Cicero in the Senate—cedant arma cottae, say the friars in the Philippines.[2]\nBut Fray Sibyla was a well-bred person, so he said, “Lieutenant, here we are in the world and not in the church. The seat of honor belongs to you.” To judge from the tone of his voice, however, even in the world it really did belong to him, and the lieutenant, either to keep out of trouble or to avoid sitting between two friars, curtly declined.\nNone of the claimants had given a thought to their host. Ibarra noticed him watching the scene with a smile of satisfaction.\n“How’s this, Don Santiago, aren’t you going to sit down with us?”\nBut all the seats were occupied; Lucullus was not to sup in the house of Lucullus.\n“Sit still, don’t get up!” said Capitan Tiago, placing his hand on the young man’s shoulder. “This fiesta is for the special purpose of giving thanks to the Virgin for your [21]safe arrival. Oy! Bring on the tinola! I ordered tinola as you doubtless have not tasted any for so long a time.”\nA large steaming tureen was brought in. The Dominican, after muttering the benedicite, to which scarcely any one knew how to respond, began to serve the contents. But whether from carelessness or other cause, Padre Damaso received a plate in which a bare neck and a tough wing of chicken floated about in a large quantity of soup amid lumps of squash, while the others were eating legs and breasts, especially Ibarra, to whose lot fell the second joints. Observing all this, the Franciscan mashed up some pieces of squash, barely tasted the soup, dropped his spoon noisily, and roughly pushed his plate away. The Dominican was very busy talking to the rubicund youth.\n“How long have you been away from the country?” Laruja asked Ibarra.\n“Almost seven years.”\n“Then you have probably forgotten all about it.”\n“Quite the contrary. Even if my country does seem to have forgotten me, I have always thought about it.”\n“How do you mean that it has forgotten you?” inquired the rubicund youth.\n“I mean that it has been a year since I have received any news from here, so that I find myself a stranger who does not yet know how and when his father died.”\nThis statement drew a sudden exclamation from the lieutenant.\n“And where were you that you didn’t telegraph?” asked Doña Victorina. “When we were married we telegraphed to the Peñinsula.”[3]\n“Señora, for the past two years I have been in the northern part of Europe, in Germany and Russian Poland.”\nDoctor De Espadaña, who until now had not ventured upon any conversation, thought this a good opportunity to say something. “I—I knew in S-spain a P-pole from [22]W-warsaw, c-called S-stadtnitzki, if I r-remember c-correctly. P-perhaps you s-saw him?” he asked timidly and almost blushingly.\n“It’s very likely,” answered Ibarra in a friendly manner, “but just at this moment I don’t recall him.”\n“B-but you c-couldn’t have c-confused him with any one else,” went on the Doctor, taking courage. “He was r-ruddy as gold and t-talked Spanish very b-badly.”\n“Those are good clues, but unfortunately while there I talked Spanish only in a few consulates.”\n“How then did you get along?” asked the wondering Doña Victorina.\n“The language of the country served my needs, madam.”\n“Do you also speak English?” inquired the Dominican, who had been in Hongkong, and who was a master of pidgin-English, that adulteration of Shakespeare’s tongue used by the sons of the Celestial Empire.\n“I stayed in England a year among people who talked nothing but English.”\n“Which country of Europe pleased you the most?” asked the rubicund youth.\n“After Spain, my second fatherland, any country of free Europe.”\n“And you who seem to have traveled so much, tell us what do you consider the most notable thing that you have seen?” inquired Laruja.\nIbarra appeared to reflect. “Notable—in what way?”\n“For example, in regard to the life of the people—the social, political, religious life—in general, in its essential features—as a whole.”\nIbarra paused thoughtfully before replying. “Frankly, I like everything in those people, setting aside the national pride of each one. But before visiting a country, I tried to familiarize myself with its history, its Exodus, if I may so speak, and afterwards I found everything quite natural. I have observed that the prosperity or misery of each people is in direct proportion to its liberties or its prejudices and, [23]accordingly, to the sacrifices or the selfishness of its forefathers.”\n“And haven’t you observed anything more than that?” broke in the Franciscan with a sneer. Since the beginning of the dinner he had not uttered a single word, his whole attention having been taking up, no doubt, with the food. “It wasn’t worth while to squander your fortune to learn so trifling a thing. Any schoolboy knows that.”\nIbarra was placed in an embarrassing position, and the rest looked from one to the other as if fearing a disagreeable scene. He was about to say, “The dinner is nearly over and his Reverence is now satiated,” but restrained himself and merely remarked to the others, “Gentlemen, don’t be surprised at the familiarity with which our former curate treats me. He treated me so when I was a child, and the years seem to make no difference in his Reverence. I appreciate it, too, because it recalls the days when his Reverence visited our home and honored my father’s table.”\nThe Dominican glanced furtively at the Franciscan, who was trembling visibly. Ibarra continued as he rose from the table: “You will now permit me to retire, since, as I have just arrived and must go away tomorrow morning, there remain some important business matters for me to attend to. The principal part of the dinner is over and I drink but little wine and seldom touch cordials. Gentlemen, all for Spain and the Philippines!” Saying this, he drained his glass, which he had not before touched. The old lieutenant silently followed his example.\n“Don’t go!” whispered Capitan Tiago. “Maria Clara will be here. Isabel has gone to get her. The new curate of your town, who is a saint, is also coming.”\n“I’ll call tomorrow before starting. I’ve a very important visit to make now.” With this he went away.\nMeanwhile the Franciscan had recovered himself. “Do you see?” he said to the rubicund youth, at the same time flourishing his dessert spoon. “That comes from pride. They can’t stand to have the curate correct them. [24]They even think that they are respectable persons. It’s the evil result of sending young men to Europe. The government ought to prohibit it.”\n“And how about the lieutenant?” Doña Victorina chimed in upon the Franciscan, “he didn’t get the frown off his face the whole evening. He did well to leave us so old and still only a lieutenant!” The lady could not forget the allusion to her frizzes and the trampled ruffles of her gown.\nThat night the rubicund youth wrote down, among other things, the following title for a chapter in his Colonial Studies: “Concerning the manner in which the neck and wing of a chicken in a friar’s plate of soup may disturb the merriment of a feast.” Among his notes there appeared these observations: “In the Philippines the most unnecessary person at a dinner is he who gives it, for they are quite capable of beginning by throwing the host into the street and then everything will go on smoothly. Under present conditions it would perhaps be a good thing not to allow the Filipinos to leave the country, and even not to teach them to read.”\n 1 “He says that he doesn’t want it when it is exactly what he does want.” An expression used in the mongrel Spanish-Tagalog ‘market language’ of Manila and Cavite, especially among the children,—somewhat akin to the English ‘sour grapes.’—TR.\n2 Arms should yield to the toga (military to civil power).

The night breeze, which during those months blows cool enough in Manila, seemed to drive from his forehead the light cloud that had darkened it. He took off his hat and drew a deep breath. Carriages flashed by, public rigs moved along at a sleepy pace, pedestrians of many nationalities were passing. He walked along at that irregular pace which indicates thoughtful abstraction or freedom from care, directing his steps toward Binondo Plaza and looking about him as if to recall the place. There were the same streets and the identical houses with their white and blue walls, whitewashed, or frescoed in bad imitation of granite; the church continued to show its illuminated clock face; there were the same Chinese shops with their soiled curtains and their iron gratings, in one of which was a bar that he, in imitation of the street urchins of Manila, had twisted one night; it was still unstraightened. “How slowly everything moves,” he murmured as he turned into Calle Sacristia. The ice-cream venders were repeating the same shrill cry, “Sorbeteee!” while the smoky lamps still lighted the identical Chinese stands and those of the old women who sold candy and fruit.\n“Wonderful!” he exclaimed. “There’s the same Chinese who was here seven years ago, and that old woman—the very same! It might be said that tonight I’ve dreamed of a seven years’ journey in Europe. Good heavens, that pavement is still in the same unrepaired condition as when I left!” True it was that the stones of the sidewalk on the corner of San Jacinto and Sacristia were still loose.\nWhile he was meditating upon this marvel of the city’s stability in a country where everything is so unstable, a hand was placed lightly on his shoulder. He raised his head to see the old lieutenant gazing at him with something like a smile in place of the hard expression and the frown which usually characterized him.\n“Young man, be careful! Learn from your father!” was the abrupt greeting of the old soldier.\n“Pardon me, but you seem to have thought a great deal of my father. Can you tell me how he died?” asked Ibarra, staring at him.\n“What! Don’t you know about it?” asked the officer.\n“I asked Don Santiago about it, but he wouldn’t promise to tell me until tomorrow. Perhaps you know?”\n“I should say I do, as does everybody else. He died in prison!”\nThe young man stepped backward a pace and gazed searchingly at the lieutenant. “In prison? Who died in prison?”\n“Your father, man, since he was in confinement,” was the somewhat surprised answer.\n“My father—in prison—confined in a prison? What are you talking about? Do you know who my father was? Are you—?” demanded the young man, seizing the officer’s arm.\n“I rather think that I’m not mistaken. He was Don Rafael Ibarra.”\n“Yes, Don Rafael Ibarra,” echoed the youth weakly.\n“Well, I thought you knew about it,” muttered the soldier in a tone of compassion as he saw what was passing in Ibarra’s mind. “I supposed that you—but be brave! Here one cannot be honest and keep out of jail.”\n“I must believe that you are not joking with me,” replied Ibarra in a weak voice, after a few moments’ silence. “Can you tell me why he was in prison?”\nThe old man seemed to be perplexed. “It’s strange to me that your family affairs were not made known to you.”\n“His last letter, a year ago, said that I should not be uneasy if he did not write, as he was very busy. He charged me to continue my studies and—sent me his blessing.”\n“Then he wrote that letter to you just before he died. It will soon be a year since we buried him.”\n“But why was my father a prisoner?”\n“For a very honorable reason. But come with me to the barracks and I’ll tell you as we go along. Take my arm.”\nThey moved along for some time in silence. The elder seemed to be in deep thought and to be seeking inspiration from his goatee, which he stroked continually.\n“As you well know,” he began, “your father was the richest man in the province, and while many loved and respected him, there were also some who envied and hated him. We Spaniards who come to the Philippines are unfortunately not all we ought to be. I say this as much on account of one of your ancestors as on account of your father’s enemies. The continual changes, the corruption in the higher circles, the favoritism, the low cost and the shortness of the journey, are to blame for it all. The worst characters of the Peninsula come here, and even if a good man does come, the country soon ruins him. So it was that your father had a number of enemies among the curates and other Spaniards.”\nHere he hesitated for a while. “Some months after your departure the troubles with Padre Damaso began, but I am unable to explain the real cause of them. Fray Damaso accused him of not coming to confession, although he had not done so formerly and they had nevertheless been good friends, as you may still remember. Moreover, Don Rafael was a very upright man, more so than many of those who regularly attend confession and than the confessors themselves. He had framed for himself a rigid morality and often said to me, when he talked of these troubles, ‘Señor Guevara, do you believe that God will pardon any crime, a murder for instance, solely by a man’s telling it to a priest—a man after all and one whose duty it is to keep quiet about it—by his fearing that he will roast in hell as a penance—by being cowardly and certainly shameless into the bargain? I have another conception of God,’ he used to say, ‘for in my opinion one evil does not correct another, nor is a crime to be expiated by vain lamentings or by giving alms to the Church. Take this example: if I have killed the father of a family, if I have made of a woman a sorrowing widow and destitute orphans of some happy children, have I satisfied eternal Justice by letting myself be hanged, or by entrusting my secret to one who is obliged to guard it for me, or by giving alms to priests who are least in need of them, or by buying indulgences and lamenting night and day? What of the widow and the orphans? My conscience tells me that I should try to take the place of him whom I killed, that I should dedicate my whole life to the welfare of the family whose misfortunes I caused. But even so, who can replace the love of a husband and a father?’ Thus your father reasoned and by this strict standard of conduct regulated all his actions, so that it can be said that he never injured anybody. On the contrary, he endeavored by his good deeds to wipe out some injustices which he said your ancestors had committed. But to get back to his troubles with the curate—these took on a serious aspect. Padre Damaso denounced him from the pulpit, and that he did not expressly name him was a miracle, since anything might have been expected of such a character. I foresaw that sooner or later the affair would have serious results.”\nAgain the old lieutenant paused. “There happened to be wandering about the province an ex-artilleryman who has been discharged from the army on account of his stupidity and ignorance. As the man had to live and he was not permitted to engage in manual labor, which would injure our prestige, he somehow or other obtained a position as collector of the tax on vehicles. The poor devil had no education at all, a fact of which the natives soon became aware, as it was a marvel for them to see a Spaniard who didn’t know how to read and write. Every one ridiculed him and the payment of the tax was the occasion of broad smiles. He knew that he was an object of ridicule and this tended to sour his disposition even more, rough and bad as it had formerly been. They would purposely hand him the papers upside down to see his efforts to read them, and wherever he found a blank space he would scribble a lot of pothooks which rather fitly passed for his signature. The natives mocked while they paid him. He swallowed his pride and made the collections, but was in such a state of mind that he had no respect for any one. He even came to have some hard words with your father.\n“One day it happened that he was in a shop turning a document over and over in the effort to get it straight when a schoolboy began to make signs to his companions and to point laughingly at the collector with his finger. The fellow heard the laughter and saw the joke reflected in the solemn faces of the bystanders. He lost his patience and, turning quickly, started to chase the boys, who ran away shouting ba, be, bi, bo, bu.[1] Blind with rage and unable to catch them, he threw his cane and struck one of the boys on the head, knocking him down. He ran up and began to kick the fallen boy, and none of those who had been laughing had the courage to interfere. Unfortunately, your father happened to come along just at that time. He ran forward indignantly, caught the collector by the arm, and reprimanded him severely. The artilleryman, who was no doubt beside himself with rage, raised his hand, but your father was too quick for him, and with the strength of a descendant of the Basques—some say that he struck him, others that he merely pushed him, but at any rate the man staggered and fell a little way off, striking his head against a stone. Don Rafael quietly picked the wounded boy up and carried him to the town hall. The artilleryman bled freely from the mouth and died a few moments later without recovering consciousness.\n“As was to be expected, the authorities intervened and arrested your father. All his hidden enemies at once rose up and false accusations came from all sides. He was accused of being a heretic and a filibuster. To be a heretic is a great danger anywhere, but especially so at that time when the province was governed by an alcalde who made a great show of his piety, who with his servants used to recite his rosary in the church in a loud voice, perhaps that all might hear and pray with him. But to be a filibuster is worse than to be a heretic and to kill three or four tax-collectors who know how to read, write, and attend to business. Every one abandoned him, and his books and papers were seized. He was accused of subscribing to El Correo de Ultramar, and to newspapers from Madrid, of having sent you to Germany, of having in his possession letters and a photograph of a priest who had been legally executed, and I don’t know what not. Everything served as an accusation, even the fact that he, a descendant of Peninsulars, wore a camisa. Had it been any one but your father, it is likely that he would soon have been set free, as there was a physician who ascribed the death of the unfortunate collector to a hemorrhage. But his wealth, his confidence in the law, and his hatred of everything that was not legal and just, wrought his undoing. In spite of my repugnance to asking for mercy from any one, I applied personally to the Captain-General—the predecessor of our present one—and urged upon him that there could not be anything of the filibuster about a man who took up with all the Spaniards, even the poor emigrants, and gave them food and shelter, and in whose veins yet flowed the generous blood of Spain. It was in vain that I pledged my life and swore by my poverty and my military honor. I succeeded only in being coldly listened to and roughly sent away with the epithet of chiflado.”[2]\n[31]The old man paused to take a deep breath, and after noticing the silence of his companion, who was listening with averted face, continued: “At your father’s request I prepared the defense in the case. I went first to the celebrated Filipino lawyer, young A———, but he refused to take the case. ‘I should lose it,’ he told me, ‘and my defending him would furnish the motive for another charge against him and perhaps one against me. Go to Señor M———, who is a forceful and fluent speaker and a Peninsular of great influence.’ I did so, and the noted lawyer took charge of the case, and conducted it with mastery and brilliance. But your father’s enemies were numerous, some of them hidden and unknown. False witnesses abounded, and their calumnies, which under other circumstances would have melted away before a sarcastic phrase from the defense, here assumed shape and substance. If the lawyer succeeded in destroying the force of their testimony by making them contradict each other and even perjure themselves, new charges were at once preferred. They accused him of having illegally taken possession of a great deal of land and demanded damages. They said that he maintained relations with the tulisanes in order that his crops and animals might not be molested by them. At last the case became so confused that at the end of a year no one understood it. The alcalde had to leave and there came in his place one who had the reputation of being honest, but unfortunately he stayed only a few months, and his successor was too fond of good horses.\n“The sufferings, the worries, the hard life in the prison, or the pain of seeing so much ingratitude, broke your father’s iron constitution and he fell ill with that malady which only the tomb can cure. When the case was almost finished and he was about to be acquitted of the charge of being an enemy of the fatherland and of being the murderer of the tax-collector, he died in the prison with no one at his side. I arrived just in time to see him breathe his last.”\nThe old lieutenant became silent, but still Ibarra said nothing. They had arrived meanwhile at the door of the barracks, so the soldier stopped and said, as he grasped the youth’s hand, “Young man, for details ask Capitan Tiago. Now, good night, as I must return to duty and see that all’s well.”\nSilently, but with great feeling, Ibarra shook the lieutenant’s bony hand and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared. Then he turned slowly and signaled to a passing carriage. “To Lala’s Hotel,” was the direction he gave in a scarcely audible voice.\n“This fellow must have just got out of jail,” thought the cochero as he whipped up his horses.\n 1 The syllables which constitute the first reading lesson in Spanish primers.—TR.\n2 A Spanish colloquial term (“cracked”), applied to a native of Spain who was considered to be mentally unbalanced from too long residence in the islands,—TR.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-iv-heretic-and-filibuster/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"The Overview is where your users find out about your project.

The house on the opposite bank was profusely lighted, and gay strains of music, largely from stringed instruments, were borne across the river even to his room.\nIf the young man had been less preoccupied, if he had had more curiosity and had cared to see with his opera glasses what was going on in that atmosphere of light, he would have been charmed with one of those magical and fantastic spectacles, the like of which is sometimes seen in the great theaters of Europe. To the subdued strains of the orchestra there seems to appear in the midst of a shower of light, a cascade of gold and diamonds in an Oriental setting, a deity wrapped in misty gauze, a sylph enveloped in a luminous halo, who moves forward apparently without touching the floor. In her presence the flowers bloom, the dance awakens, the music bursts forth, and troops of devils, nymphs, satyrs, demons, angels, shepherds and shepherdesses, dance, shake their tambourines, and whirl about in rhythmic evolutions, each one placing some tribute at the feet of the goddess. Ibarra would have seen a beautiful and graceful maiden, clothed in the picturesque garments of the daughters of the Philippines, standing in the center Of a semicircle made up of every class of people, Chinese, Spaniards, Filipinos, soldiers, curates, old men and young, all gesticulating and moving about in a lively manner. Padre Damaso stood at the side of the beauty, smiling like one especially blessed. Fray Sibyla—yes, Fray Sibyla himself—was talking to her. Doña Victorina was arranging in the magnificent hair of the maiden a string of pearls and diamonds which threw out all the beautiful tints of the rainbow. She was white, perhaps too much so, and whenever she raised her downcast eyes there shone forth a spotless soul. When she smiled so as to show her small white teeth the beholder realized that the rose is only a flower and ivory but the elephant’s tusk. From out the filmy piña draperies around her white and shapely neck there blinked, as the Tagalogs say, the bright eyes of a collar of diamonds. One man only in all the crowd seemed insensible to her radiant influence—a young Franciscan, thin, wasted, and pale, who watched her from a distance, motionless as a statue and scarcely breathing.\nBut Ibarra saw nothing of all this—his eyes were fixed on other things. A small space was enclosed by four bare and grimy walls, in one of which was an iron grating. On the filthy and loathsome floor was a mat upon which an old man lay alone in the throes of death, an old man breathing with difficulty and turning his head from side to side as amid his tears he uttered a name. The old man was alone, but from time to time a groan or the rattle of a chain was heard on the other side of the wall. Far away there was a merry feast, almost an orgy; a youth was laughing, shouting, and pouring wine upon the flowers amid the applause and drunken laughter of his companions. The old man had the features of his father, the youth was himself, and the name that the old man uttered with tears was his own name! This was what the wretched young man saw before him. The lights in the house opposite were extinguished, the music and the noises ceased, but Ibarra still heard the anguished cry of his father calling upon his son in the hour of his death.\nSilence had now blown its hollow breath over the city, and all things seemed to sleep in the embrace of nothingness. The cock-crow alternated with the strokes of the clocks in the church towers and the mournful cries of the weary [35]sentinels. A waning moon began to appear, and everything seemed to be at rest; even Ibarra himself, worn out by his sad thoughts or by his journey, now slept.\nOnly the young Franciscan whom we saw not so long ago standing motionless and silent in the midst of the gaiety of the ballroom slept not, but kept vigil. In his cell, with his elbow upon the window sill and his pale, worn cheek resting on the palm of his hand, he was gazing silently into the distance where a bright star glittered in the dark sky. The star paled and disappeared, the dim light of the waning moon faded, but the friar did not move from his place—he was gazing out over the field of Bagumbayan and the sleeping sea at the far horizon wrapped in the morning mist.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-v-a-star-in-a-dark-night/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter VI – Capitan Tiago  Thy will be done on earth.\n While our characters are deep in slumber or busy with their breakfasts, let us turn our attention to Capitan Tiago. We have never had the honor of being his guest, so it is neither our right nor our duty to pass him by slightingly, even under the stress of important events.\nLow in stature, with a clear complexion, a corpulent figure and a full face, thanks to the liberal supply of fat which according to his admirers was the gift of Heaven and which his enemies averred was the blood of the poor, Capitan Tiago appeared to be younger than he really was; he might have been thought between thirty and thirty-five years of age. At the time of our story his countenance always wore a sanctified look; his little round head, covered with ebony-black hair cut long in front and short behind, was reputed to contain many things of weight; his eyes, small but with no Chinese slant, never varied in expression; his nose was slender and not at all inclined to flatness; and if his mouth had not been disfigured by the immoderate use of tobacco and buyo, which, when chewed and gathered in one cheek, marred the symmetry of his features, we would say that he might properly have considered himself a handsome man and have passed for such. Yet in spite of this bad habit he kept marvelously white both his natural teeth and also the two which the dentist furnished him at twelve pesos each.\nHe was considered one of the richest landlords in Binondo and a planter of some importance by reason of his estates in Pampanga and Laguna, principally in the town of San Diego, the income from which increased with each year. San Diego, on account of its agreeable baths, its famous cockpit, and his cherished memories of the place, was his favorite town, so that he spent at least two months of the year there. His holdings of real estate in the city were large, and it is superfluous to state that the opium monopoly controlled by him and a Chinese brought in large profits. They also had the lucrative contract of feeding the prisoners in Bilibid and furnished zacate to many of the stateliest establishments in Manila u through the medium of contracts, of course. Standing well with all the authorities, clever, cunning, and even bold in speculating upon the wants of others, he was the only formidable rival of a certain Perez in the matter of the farming-out of revenues and the sale of offices and appointments, which the Philippine government always confides to private persons. Thus, at the time of the events here narrated, Capitan Tiago was a happy man in so far as it is possible for a narrow-brained individual to be happy in such a land: he was rich, and at peace with God, the government, and men.\nThat he was at peace with God was beyond doubt,—almost like religion itself. There is no need to be on bad terms with the good God when one is prosperous on earth, when one has never had any direct dealings with Him and has never lent Him any money. Capitan Tiago himself had never offered any prayers to Him, even in his greatest difficulties, for he was rich and his gold prayed for him. For masses and supplications high and powerful priests had been created; for novenas and rosaries God in His infinite bounty had created the poor for the service of the rich—the poor who for a peso could be secured to recite sixteen mysteries and to read all the sacred books, even the Hebrew Bible, for a little extra. If at any time in the midst of pressing difficulties he needed celestial aid and had not at hand even a red Chinese taper, he would call upon his most adored saints, promising them many things for the purpose of putting them under obligation to him and ultimately convincing them of the righteousness of his desires.\nThe saint to whom he promised the most, and whose promises he was the most faithful in fulfilling, was the Virgin of Antipolo, Our Lady of Peace and Prosperous Voyages.[1] With many of the lesser saints he was not very punctual or even decent; and sometimes, after having his petitions granted, he thought no more about them, though of course after such treatment he did not bother them again, when occasion arose. Capitan Tiago knew that the calendar was full of idle saints who perhaps had nothing wherewith to occupy their time up there in heaven. Furthermore, to the Virgin of Antipolo he ascribed greater power and efficiency than to all the other Virgins combined, whether they carried silver canes, naked or richly clothed images of the Christ Child, scapularies, rosaries, or girdles. Perhaps this reverence was owing to the fact that she was a very strict Lady, watchful of her name, and, according to the senior sacristan of Antipolo, an enemy of photography. When she was angered she turned black as ebony, while the other Virgins were softer of heart and more indulgent. It is a well-known fact that some minds love an absolute monarch rather than a constitutional one, as witness Louis XIV and Louis XVI, Philip II and Amadeo I. This fact perhaps explains why infidel Chinese and even Spaniards may be seen kneeling in the famous sanctuary; what is not explained is why the priests run away with the money of the terrible Image, go to America, and get married there.\nIn the sala of Capitan Tiago’s house, that door, hidden by a silk curtain leads to a small chapel or oratory such as must be lacking in no Filipino home. There were placed his household gods—and we say “gods” because he was inclined to polytheism rather than to monotheism, which he had never come to understand. There could be seen images of the Holy Family with busts and extremities of ivory, glass eyes, long eyelashes, and curly blond hair—masterpieces of Santa Cruz sculpture. Paintings in oil by artists of Paco and Ermita[2] represented martyrdoms of saints and miracles of the Virgin; St. Lucy gazing at the sky and carrying in a plate an extra pair of eyes with lashes and eyebrows, such as are seen painted in the triangle of the Trinity or on Egyptian tombs; St. Pascual Bailon; St. Anthony of Padua in a guingón habit looking with tears upon a Christ Child dressed as a Captain-General with the three-cornered hat, sword, and boots, as in the children’s ball at Madrid that character is represented—which signified for Capitan Tiago that while God might include in His omnipotence the power of a Captain-General of the Philippines, the Franciscans would nevertheless play with Him as with a doll. There, might also be seen a St. Anthony the Abbot with a hog by his side, a hog that for the worthy Capitan was as miraculous as the saint himself, for which reason he never dared to refer to it as the hog, but as the creature of holy St. Anthony; a St. Francis of Assisi in a coffee-colored robe and with seven wings, placed over a St. Vincent who had only two but in compensation carried a trumpet; a St. Peter the Martyr with his head split open by the talibon of an evil-doer and held fast by a kneeling infidel, side by side with another St. Peter cutting off the ear of a Moro, Malchus[3] no doubt, who was gnawing his lips and writhing with pain, while a fighting-cock on a doric column crowed and flapped his wings—from all of which Capitan Tiago deduced that in order to be a saint it was just as well to smite as to be smitten.\nWho could enumerate that army of images and recount the virtues and perfections that were treasured there! A whole chapter would hardly suffice. Yet we must not pass over in silence a beautiful St. Michael of painted and gilded wood almost four feet high. The Archangel is biting his lower lip and with flashing eyes, frowning forehead, and rosy cheeks is grasping a Greek shield and brandishing in his right hand a Sulu kris, ready, as would appear from his attitude and expression, to smite a worshiper or any one else who might approach, rather than the horned and tailed devil that had his teeth set in his girlish leg.\nCapitan Tiago never went near this image from fear of a miracle. Had not other images, even those more rudely carved ones that issue from the carpenter shops of Paete,[4] many times come to life for the confusion and punishment of incredulous sinners? It is a well-known fact that a certain image of Christ in Spain, when invoked as a witness of promises of love, had assented with a movement of the head in the presence of the judge, and that another such image had reached out its right arm to embrace St. Lutgarda. And furthermore, had he not himself read a booklet recently published about a mimic sermon preached by an image of St. Dominic in Soriano? True, the saint had not said a single word, but from his movements it was inferred, at any rate the author of the booklet inferred, that he was announcing the end of the world.[5] Was it not reported, too, that the Virgin of Luta in the town of Lipa had one cheek swollen larger than the other and that there was mud on the borders of her gown? Does not this prove mathematically that the holy images also walk about without holding up their skirts and that they even suffer from the toothache, perhaps for our sake? Had he not seen with his own eyes, during the regular Good-Friday sermon, all the images of Christ move and bow their heads thrice in unison, thereby calling forth wails and cries from the women and other sensitive souls destined for Heaven? More? We ourselves have seen the preacher show to the congregation at the moment of the descent from the cross a handkerchief stained with blood, and were ourselves on the point of weeping piously, when, to the sorrow of our soul, a sacristan assured us that it was all a joke, that the blood was that of a chicken which had been roasted and eaten on the spot in spite of the fact that it was Good Friday—and the sacristan was fat! So Capitan Tiago, even though he was a prudent and pious individual, took care not to approach the kris of St. Michael. “Let’s take no chances,” he would say to himself, “I know that he’s an archangel, but I don’t trust him, no, I don’t trust him.”\nNot a year passed without his joining with an orchestra in the pilgrimage to the wealthy shrine of Antipolo. He paid for two thanksgiving masses of the many that make up the three novenas, and also for the days when there are no novenas, and washed himself afterwards in the famous bátis, or pool, where the sacred Image herself had bathed. Her votaries can even yet discern the tracks of her feet and the traces of her locks in the hard rock, where she dried them, resembling exactly those made by any woman who uses coconut-oil, and just as if her hair had been steel or diamonds and she had weighed a thousand tons. We should like to see the terrible Image once shake her sacred hair in the eyes of those credulous persons and put her foot upon their tongues or their heads. There at the very edge of the pool Capitan Tiago made it his duty to eat roast pig, sinigang of dalag with alibambang leaves, and other more or less appetizing dishes. The two masses would cost him over four hundred pesos, but it was cheap, after all, if one considered the glory that the Mother of the Lord would acquire from the pin-wheels, rockets, bombs, and mortars, and also the increased profits which, thanks to these masses, would come to one during the year.\nBut Antipolo was not the only theater of his ostentatious devotion. In Binondo, in Pampanga, and in the town of San Diego, when he was about to put up a fighting-cock with large wagers, he would send gold moneys to the curate for propitiatory masses and, just as the Romans consulted the augurs before a battle, giving food to the sacred fowls, so Capitan Tiago would also consult his augurs, with the modifications befitting the times and the new truths, tie would watch closely the flame of the tapers, the smoke from the incense, the voice of the priest, and from it all attempt to forecast his luck. It was an admitted fact that he lost very few wagers, and in those cases it was due to the unlucky circumstance that the officiating priest was hoarse, or that the altar-candles were few or contained too much tallow, or that a bad piece of money had slipped in with the rest. The warden of the Brotherhood would then assure him that such reverses were tests to which he was subjected by Heaven to receive assurance of his fidelity and devotion. So, beloved by the priests, respected by the sacristans, humored by the Chinese chandlers and the dealers in fireworks, he was a man happy in the religion of this world, and persons of discernment and great piety even claimed for him great influence in the celestial court.\nThat he was at peace with the government cannot be doubted, however difficult an achievement it may seem. Incapable of any new idea and satisfied with his modus vivendi, he was ever ready to gratify the desires of the last official of the fifth class in every one of the offices, to make presents of hams, capons, turkeys, and Chinese fruits at all seasons of the year. If he heard any one speak ill of the natives, he, who did not consider himself as such, would join in the chorus and speak worse of them; if any one aspersed the Chinese or Spanish mestizos, he would do the same, perhaps because he considered himself become a full-blooded Iberian. He was ever first to talk in favor of any new imposition of taxes, or special assessment, especially when he smelled a contract or a farming assignment behind it. He always had an orchestra ready for congratulating and serenading the governors, judges, and other officials on their name-days and birthdays, at the birth or death of a relative, and in fact at every variation from the usual monotony. For such occasions he would secure laudatory poems and hymns in which were celebrated “the kind and loving governor,” “the brave and courageous judge for whom there awaits in heaven the palm of the just,” with many other things of the same kind.\nHe was the president of the rich guild of mestizos in spite of the protests of many of them, who did not regard him as one of themselves. In the two years that he held this office he wore out ten frock coats, an equal number of high hats, and half a dozen canes. The frock coat and the high hat were in evidence at the Ayuntamiento, in the governor-general’s palace, and at military headquarters; the high hat and the frock coat might have been noticed in the cockpit, in the market, in the processions, in the Chinese shops, and under the hat and within the coat might have been seen the perspiring Capitan Tiago, waving his tasseled cane, directing, arranging, and throwing everything into disorder with marvelous activity and a gravity even more marvelous.\nSo the authorities saw in him a safe man, gifted with the best of dispositions, peaceful, tractable, and obsequious, who read no books or newspapers from Spain, although he spoke Spanish well. Indeed, they rather looked upon him with the feeling with which a poor student contemplates the worn-out heel of his old shoe, twisted by his manner of walking. In his case there was truth in both the Christian and profane proverbs beati pauperes spiritu and beati possidentes,[6] and there might well be applied to him that translation, according to some people incorrect, from the Greek, “Glory to God in the highest and peace to men of good-will on earth!” even though we shall see further along that it is not sufficient for men to have good-will in order to live in peace.\nThe irreverent considered him a fool, the poor regarded him as a heartless and cruel exploiter of misery and want, and his inferiors saw in him a despot and a tyrant. As to the women, ah, the women! Accusing rumors buzzed through the wretched nipa huts, and it was said that wails and sobs might be heard mingled with the weak cries of an infant. More than one young woman was pointed out by her neighbors with the finger of scorn: she had a downcast glance and a faded cheek. But such things never robbed him of sleep nor did any maiden disturb his peace. It was an old woman who made him suffer, an old woman who was his rival in piety and who had gained from many curates such enthusiastic praises and eulogies as he in his best days had never received.\nBetween Capitan Tiago and this widow, who had inherited from brothers and cousins, there existed a holy rivalry which redounded to the benefit of the Church as the competition among the Pampanga steamers then redounded to the benefit of the public. Did Capitan Tiago present to some Virgin a silver wand ornamented with emeralds and topazes? At once Doña Patrocinio had ordered another of gold set with diamonds! If at the time of the Naval procession[7] Capitan Tiago erected an arch with two façades, covered with ruffled cloth and decorated with mirrors, glass globes, and chandeliers, then Doña Patrocinio would have another with four facades, six feet higher, and more gorgeous hangings. Then he would fall back on his reserves, his strong point, his specialty—masses with bombs and fireworks; whereat Doña Patrocinia could only gnaw at her lips with her toothless gums, because, being exceedingly nervous, she could not endure the chiming of the bells and still less the explosions of the bombs. While he smiled in triumph, she would plan her revenge and pay the money of others to secure the best orators of the five Orders in Manila, the most famous preachers of the Cathedral, and even the Paulists,[8] to preach on the holy days upon profound theological subjects to the sinners who understood only the vernacular of the mariners. The partizans of Capitan Tiago would observe that she slept during the sermon; but her adherents would answer that the sermon was paid for in advance, and by her, and that in any affair payment was the prime requisite. At length, she had driven him from the field completely by presenting to the church three andas of gilded silver, each one of which cost her over three thousand pesos. Capitan Tiago hoped that the old woman would breathe her last almost any day, or that she would lose five or six of her lawsuits, so that he might be alone in serving God; but unfortunately the best lawyers of the* Real Audiencia* looked after her interests, and as to her health, there was no part of her that could be attacked by sickness; she seemed to be a steel wire, no doubt for the edification of souls, and she hung on in this vale of tears with the tenacity of a boil on the skin. Her adherents were secure in the belief that she would be canonized at her death and that Capitan Tiago himself would have to worship her at the altars—all of which he agreed to and cheerfully promised, provided only that she die soon.\nSuch was Capitan Tiago in the days of which we write. As for the past, he was the only son of a sugar-planter of Malabon, wealthy enough, but so miserly that he would not spend a cent to educate his son, for which reason the little Santiago had been the servant of a good Dominican, a worthy man who had tried to train him in all of good that he knew and could teach. When he had reached the happy stage of being known among his acquaintances as a logician, that is, when he began to study logic, the death of his protector, soon followed by that of his father, put an end to his studies and he had to turn his attention to business affairs. He married a pretty young woman of Santa Cruz, who gave him social position and helped him to make his fortune. Doña Pia Alba was not satisfied with buying and selling sugar, indigo, and coffee, but wished to plant and reap, so the newly-married couple bought land in San Diego. From this time dated their friendship with Padre Damoso and with Don Rafael Ibarra, the richest capitalist of the town.\nThe lack of an heir in the first six years of their wedded life made of that eagerness to accumulate riches almost a censurable ambition. Doña Pia was comely, strong, and healthy, yet it was in vain that she offered novenas and at the advice of the devout women of San Diego made a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Kaysaysay[9] in Taal, distributed alms to the poor, and danced at midday in May in the procession of the Virgin of Turumba[10] in Pakil. But it was all with no result until Fray Damaso advised her to go to Obando to dance in the fiesta of St. Pascual Bailon and ask him for a son. Now it is well known that there is in Obando a trinity which grants sons or daughters according to request—Our Lady of Salambaw, St. Clara, and St. Pascual. Thanks to this wise advice, Doña Pia soon recognized the signs of approaching motherhood. But alas! like the fisherman of whom Shakespeare tells in Macbeth, who ceased to sing when he had found a treasure, she at once lost all her mirthfulness, fell into melancholy, and was never seen to smile again. “Capriciousness, natural in her condition,” commented all, even Capitan Tiago. A puerperal fever put an end to her hidden grief, and she died, leaving behind a beautiful girl baby for whom Fray Damaso himself stood sponsor. As St. Pascual had not granted the son that was asked, they gave the child the name of Maria Clara, in honor of the Virgin of Salambaw and St. Clara, punishing the worthy St. Pascual with silence.\nThe little girl grew up under the care of her aunt Isabel, that good old lady of monkish urbanity whom we met at the beginning of the story. For the most part, her early life was spent in San Diego, on account of its healthful climate, and there Padre Damaso was devoted to her.\nMaria Clara had not the small eyes of her father; like her mother, she had eyes large, black, long-lashed, merry and smiling when she was playing but sad, deep, and pensive in moments of repose. As a child her hair was curly and almost blond, her straight nose was neither too pointed nor too flat, while her mouth with the merry dimples at the corners recalled the small and pleasing one of her mother, her skin had the fineness of an onion-cover and was white as cotton, according to her perplexed relatives, who found the traces of Capitan Tiago’s paternity in her small and shapely ears. Aunt Isabel ascribed her half-European features to the longings of Doña Pia, whom she remembered to have seen many times weeping before the image of St. Anthony. Another cousin was of the same opinion, differing only in the choice of the smut, as for her it was either the Virgin herself or St. Michael. A famous philosopher, who was the cousin of Capitan Tinong and who had memorized the “Amat,”[11] sought for the true explanation in planetary influences.\nThe idol of all, Maria Clara grew up amidst smiles and love. The very friars showered her with attentions when she appeared in the processions dressed in white, her abundant hair interwoven with tuberoses and sampaguitas, with two diminutive wings of silver and gold fastened on the back of her gown, and carrying in her hands a pair of white doves tied with blue ribbons. Afterwards, she would be so merry and talk so sweetly in her childish simplicity that the enraptured Capitan Tiago could do nothing but bless the saints of Obando and advise every one to purchase beautiful works of sculpture.\nIn southern countries the girl of thirteen or fourteen years changes into a woman as the bud of the night becomes a flower in the morning. At this period of change, so full of mystery and romance, Maria Clara was placed, by the advice of the curate of Binondo, in the nunnery of St. Catherine[12] in order to receive strict religious training from the Sisters. With tears she took leave of Padre Damaso and of the only lad who had been a friend of her childhood, Crisostomo Ibarra, who himself shortly afterward went away to Europe. There in that convent, which communicates with the world through double bars, even under the watchful eyes of the nuns, she spent seven years.\nEach having his own particular ends in view and knowing the mutual inclinations of the two young persons, Don Rafael and Capitan Tiago agreed upon the marriage of their children and the formation of a business partnership. This agreement, which was concluded some years after the younger Ibarra’s departure, was celebrated with equal joy by two hearts in widely separated parts of the world and under very different circumstances.\n 1 This celebrated Lady was first brought from Acapulco, Mexico, by Juan Niño de Tabora, when he came to govern the Philippines in 1626. By reason of her miraculous powers of allaying the storms she was carried back and forth in the state galleons on a number of voyages, until in 1672 she was formally installed in a church in the hills northeast of Manila, under the care of the Augustinian Fathers. While her shrine was building she is said to have appeared to the faithful in the top of a large breadfruit tree, which is known to the Tagalogs as “antipolo”; hence her name. Hers is the best known and most frequented shrine in the country, while she disputes with the Holy Child of Cebu the glory of being the wealthiest individual in the whole archipelago.\nThere has always existed a pious rivalry between her and the Dominicans’ Lady of the Rosary as to which is the patron saint of the Philippines, the contest being at times complicated by counterclaims on the part of St. Francis, although the entire question would seem to have been definitely settled by a royal decree, published about 1650, officially conferring that honorable post upon St. Michael the Archangel (San Miguel).

Her discovery, over two and a half centuries ago, is notable in that she was found in the sea during some fisheries, coming up in a drag-net with the fish. It is thought that this venerable image of the Filipinos may have been in some ship which was wrecked and that the currents carried her up to the coast, where she was found in the manner related.\n“The Indians, naturally credulous and for the most part quite superstitious, in spite of the advancements in civilization and culture, relate that she appeared afterwards in some trees, and in memory of these manifestations an arch representing them was erected at a short distance from the place where her sanctuary is now located.”—Buzeta and Bravo’s Diccionario, Madrid, 1850, but copied “with proper modifications for the times and the new truths” from Zuñiga’s Estadismo, which, though written in 1803 and not published until 1893, was yet used by later writers, since it was preserved in manuscript in the convent of the Augustinians in Manila, Buzeta and Bravo, as well as Zuñiga, being members of that order.\nSo great was the reverence for this Lady that the Acapulco galleons on their annual voyages were accustomed to fire salutes in her honor as they passed along the coast near her shrine.—Foreman.

Scarcely had the priest disappeared from the altar when the maiden expressed a desire for returning home, to the great surprise and displeasure of her good aunt, who believed her niece to be as pious and devoted to praying as a nun, at least. Grumbling and crossing herself, the good old lady rose. “The good Lord will forgive me, Aunt Isabel, since He must know the hearts of girls better than you do,” Maria Clara might have said to check the severe yet maternal chidings.\nAfter they had breakfasted, Maria Clara consumed her impatience in working at a silk purse while her aunt was trying to clean up the traces of the former night’s revelry by swinging a feather duster about. Capitan Tiago was busy looking over some papers. Every noise in the street, every carriage that passed, caused the maiden to tremble and quickened the beatings of her heart. Now she wished that she were back in the quiet convent among her friends; there she could have seen him without emotion and agitation! But was he not the companion of her infancy, had they not played together and even quarreled at times? The reason for all this I need not explain; if you, O reader, have ever loved, you will understand; and if you have not, it is useless for me to tell you, as the uninitiated do not comprehend these mysteries.\n“I believe, Maria, that the doctor is right,” said Capitan Tiago. “You ought to go into the country, for you are pale and need fresh air. What do you think of Malabon or San Diego?” At the mention of the latter place Maria Clara blushed like a poppy and was unable to answer.\n“You and Isabel can go at once to the convent to get your clothes and to say good-by to your friends,” he continued, without raising his head. “You will not stay there any longer.”\nThe girl felt the vague sadness that possesses the mind when we leave forever a place where we have been happy, but another thought softened this sorrow.\n“In four or five days, after you get some new clothes made, we’ll go to Malabon. Your godfather is no longer in San Diego. The priest that you may have noticed here last night, that young padre, is the new curate whom we have there, and he is a saint.”\n“I think that San Diego would be better, cousin,” observed Aunt Isabel. “Besides, our house there is better and the time for the fiesta draws near.”\nMaria Clara wanted to embrace her aunt for this speech, but hearing a carriage stop, she turned pale.\n“Ah, very true,” answered Capitan Tiago, and then in a different tone he exclaimed, “Don Crisostomo!”\nThe maiden let her sewing fall from her hands and wished to move but could not—a violent tremor ran through her body. Steps were heard on the stairway and then a fresh, manly voice. As if that voice had some magic power, the maiden controlled her emotion and ran to hide in the oratory among the saints. The two cousins laughed, and Ibarra even heard the noise of the door closing. Pale and breathing rapidly, the maiden pressed her beating heart and tried to listen. She heard his voice, that beloved voice that for so long a time she had heard only in her dreams he was asking for her! Overcome with joy, she kissed the nearest saint, which happened to be St. Anthony the Abbot, a saint happy in flesh and in wood, ever the object of pleasing temptations! Afterwards she sought the keyhole in order to see and examine him. She smiled, and when her aunt snatched her from that position she unconsciously threw her arms around the old lady’s neck and rained kisses upon her.\n“Foolish child, what’s the matter with you?” the old lady was at last able to say as she wiped a tear from her faded eyes. Maria Clara felt ashamed and covered her eyes with her plump arm.\n“Come on, get ready, come!” added the old aunt fondly. “While he is talking to your father about you. Come, don’t make him wait.” Like a child the maiden obediently followed her and they shut themselves up in her chamber.\nCapitan Tiago and Ibarra were conversing in a lively manner when Aunt Isabel appeared half dragging her niece, who was looking in every direction except toward the persons in the room.\nWhat said those two souls communicating through the language of the eyes, more perfect than that of the lips, the language given to the soul in order that sound may not mar the ecstasy of feeling? In such moments, when the thoughts of two happy beings penetrate into each other’s souls through the eyes, the spoken word is halting, rude, and weak—it is as the harsh, slow roar of the thunder compared with the rapidity of the dazzling lightning flash, expressing feelings already recognized, ideas already understood, and if words are made use of it is only because the heart’s desire, dominating all the being and flooding it with happiness, wills that the whole human organism with all its physical and psychical powers give expression to the song of joy that rolls through the soul. To the questioning glance of love, as it flashes out and then conceals itself, speech has no reply; the smile, the kiss, the sigh answer.\n[53]Soon the two lovers, fleeing from the dust raised by Aunt Isabel’s broom, found themselves on the azotea where they could commune in liberty among the little arbors. What did they tell each other in murmurs that you nod your heads, O little red cypress flowers? Tell it, you who have fragrance in your breath and color on your lips. And thou, O zephyr, who learnest rare harmonies in the stillness of the dark night amid the hidden depths of our virgin forests! Tell it, O sunbeams, brilliant manifestation upon earth of the Eternal, sole immaterial essence in a material world, you tell it, for I only know how to relate prosaic commonplaces. But since you seem unwilling to do so, I am going to try myself.\nThe sky was blue and a fresh breeze, not yet laden with the fragrance of roses, stirred the leaves and flowers of the vines; that is why the cypresses, the orchids, the dried fishes, and the Chinese lanterns were trembling. The splash of paddles in the muddy waters of the river and the rattle of carriages and carts passing over the Binondo bridge came up to them distinctly, although they did not hear what the old aunt murmured as she saw where they were: “That’s better, there you’ll be watched by the whole neighborhood.” At first they talked nonsense, giving utterance only to those sweet inanities which are so much like the boastings of the nations of Europe—pleasing and honey-sweet at home, but causing foreigners to laugh or frown.\nShe, like a sister of Cain, was of course jealous and asked her sweetheart, “Have you always thought of me? Have you never forgotten me on all your travels in the great cities among so many beautiful women?”\nHe, too, was a brother of Cain, and sought to evade such questions, making use of a little fiction. “Could I forget you?” he answered as he gazed enraptured into her dark eyes. “Could I be faithless to my oath, my sacred oath? Do you remember that stormy night when you saw me weeping alone by the side of my dead mother and, drawing [54]near to me, you put your hand on my shoulder, that hand which for so long a time you had not allowed me to touch, saying to me, ‘You have lost your mother while I never had one,’ and you wept with me? You loved her and she looked upon you as a daughter. Outside it rained and the lightning flashed, but within I seemed to hear music and to see a smile on the pallid face of the dead. Oh, that my parents were alive and might behold you now! I then caught your hand along with the hand of my mother and swore to love you and to make you happy, whatever fortune Heaven might have in store for me; and that oath, which has never weighed upon me as a burden, I now renew!\n“Could I forget you? The thought of you has ever been with me, strengthening me amid the dangers of travel, and has been a comfort to my soul’s loneliness in foreign lands. The thoughts of you have neutralized the lotus-effect of Europe, which erases from the memories of so many of our countrymen the hopes and misfortunes of our fatherland. In dreams I saw you standing on the shore at Manila, gazing at the far horizon wrapped in the warm light of the early dawn. I heard the slow, sad song that awoke in me sleeping affections and called back to the memory of my heart the first years of our childhood, our joys, our pleasures, and all that happy past which you gave life to while you were in our town. It seemed to me that you were the fairy, the spirit, the poetic incarnation of my fatherland, beautiful, unaffected, lovable, frank, a true daughter of the Philippines, that beautiful land which unites with the imposing virtues of the mother country, Spain, the admirable qualities of a young people, as you unite in your being all that is beautiful and lovely, the inheritance of both races” so indeed the love of you and that of my fatherland have become fused into one.\n“Could I forget you? Many times have I thought that I heard the sound of your piano and the accents of your voice. When in Germany, as I wandered at twilight [55]in the woods, peopled with the fantastic creations of its poets and the mysterious legends of past generations, always I called upon your name, imagining that I saw you in the mists that rose from the depths of the valley, or I fancied that I heard your voice in the rustling of the leaves. When from afar I heard the songs of the peasants as they returned from their labors, it seemed to me that their tones harmonized with my inner voices, that they were singing for you, and thus they lent reality to my illusions and dreams. At times I became lost among the mountain paths and while the night descended slowly, as it does there, I would find myself still wandering, seeking my way among the pines and beeches and oaks. Then when some scattering rays of moonlight slipped down into the clear spaces left in the dense foliage, I seemed to see you in the heart of the forest as a dim, loving shade wavering about between the spots of light and shadow. If perhaps the nightingale poured forth his varied trills, I fancied it was because he saw you and was inspired by you.\n“Have I thought of you? The fever of love not only gave warmth to the snows but colored the ice! The beautiful skies of Italy with their clear depths reminded me of your eyes, its sunny landscape spoke to me of your smile; the plains of Andalusia with their scent-laden airs, peopled with oriental memories, full of romance and color, told me of your love! On dreamy, moonlit nights, while boating oil the Rhine, I have asked myself if my fancy did not deceive me as I saw you among the poplars on the banks, on the rocks of the Lorelei, or in the midst of the waters, singing in the silence of the night as if you were a comforting fairy maiden sent to enliven the solitude and sadness of those ruined castles!”\n“I have not traveled like you, so I know only your town and Manila and Antipolo,” she answered with a smile which showed that she believed all he said. “But since I said good-by to you and entered the convent, I have always thought of you and have only put you out of my mind when ordered to do so by my confessor, who imposed many penances upon me. I recalled our games and our quarrels when we were children. You used to pick up the most beautiful shells and search in the river for the roundest and smoothest pebbles of different colors that we might play games with them. You were very stupid and always lost, and by way of a forfeit I would slap you with the palm of my hand, but I always tried not to strike you hard, for I had pity on you. In those games you cheated much, even more than I did, and we used to finish our play in a quarrel. Do you remember that time when you became really angry at me? Then you made me suffer, but afterwards, when I thought of it in the convent, I smiled and longed for you so that we might quarrel again—so that we might once more make up. We were still children and had gone with your mother to bathe in the brook under the shade of the thick bamboo. On the banks grew many flowers and plants whose strange names you told me in Latin and Spanish, for you were even then studying in the Ateneo.[1] I paid no attention, but amused myself by running after the needle-like dragon-flies and the butterflies with their rainbow colors and tints of mother-of-pearl as they swarmed about among the flowers. Sometimes I tried to surprise them with my hands or to catch the little fishes that slipped rapidly about amongst the moss and stones in the edge of the water. Once you disappeared suddenly and when you returned you brought a crown of leaves and orange blossoms, which you placed upon my head, calling me Chloe. For yourself you made one of vines. But your mother snatched away my crown, and after mashing it with a stone mixed it with the gogo with which she was going to wash our heads. The tears came into your eyes and you said that she did not understand mythology. ‘Silly boy,’ your mother exclaimed, ‘you’ll see how sweet your hair will smell afterwards.’ I laughed, but you were offended and would not talk with me, and for the rest of the day appeared so serious that then I wanted to cry. On our way back to the town through the hot sun, I picked some sage leaves that grew beside the path and gave them to you to put in your hat so that you might not get a headache. You smiled and caught my hand, and we made up.”\nIbarra smiled with happiness as he opened his pocketbook and took from it a piece of paper in which were wrapped some dry, blackened leaves which gave off a sweet odor. “Your sage leaves,” he said, in answer to her inquiring look. “This is all that you have ever given me.”\nShe in turn snatched from her bosom a little pouch of white satin. “You must not touch this,” she said, tapping the palm of his hand lightly. “It’s a letter of farewell.”\n“The one I wrote to you before leaving?”\n“Have you ever written me any other, sir?”\n“And what did I say to you then?”\n“Many fibs, excuses of a delinquent debtor,” she answered smilingly, thus giving him to understand how sweet to her those fibs were. “Be quiet now and I’ll read it to you. I’ll leave out your fine phrases in order not to make a martyr of you.”\nRaising the paper to the height of her eyes so that the youth might not see her face, she began: “‘My’—but I’ll not read what follows that because it’s not true.”\nHer eyes ran along some lines.\n“‘My father wishes me to go away, in spite of all my pleadings. ‘You are a man now,’ he told me, ‘and you must think about your future and about your duties. You must learn the science of life, a thing which your fatherland cannot teach you, so that you may some day be useful to it. If you remain here in my shadow, in this environment of business affairs, you will not learn to look far ahead. The day in which you lose me you will find yourself like the plant of which our poet Baltazar tells: grown in the water, its leaves wither at the least scarcity of moisture [58]and a moment’s heat dries it up. Don’t you understand? You are almost a young man, and yet you weep!’ These reproaches hurt me and I confessed that I loved you. My father reflected for a time in silence and then, placing his hand on my shoulder, said in a trembling voice, ‘Do you think that you alone know how to love, that your father does not love you, and that he will not feel the separation from you? It is only a short time since we lost your mother, and I must journey on alone toward old age, toward the very time of life when I would seek help and comfort from your youth, yet I accept my loneliness, hardly knowing whether I shall ever see you again. But you must think of other and greater things; the future lies open before you, while for me it is already passing behind; your love is just awakening, while mine is dying; fire burns in your blood, while the chill is creeping into mine. Yet you weep and cannot sacrifice the present for the future, useful as it may be alike to yourself and to your country.’ My father’s eyes filled with tears and I fell upon my knees at his feet, I embraced him, I begged his forgiveness, and I assured him that I was ready to set out—’”\nIbarra’s growing agitation caused her to suspend the reading, for he had grown pale and was pacing back and forth.\n“What’s the matter? What is troubling you?” she asked him.\n“You have almost made me forget that I have my duties, that I must leave at once for the town. Tomorrow is the day for commemorating the dead.”\nMaria Clara silently fixed her large dreamy eyes upon him for a few moments and then, picking some flowers, she said with emotion, “Go, I won’t detain you longer! In a few days we shall see each other again. Lay these flowers on the tomb of your parents.”\nA few moments later the youth descended the stairway accompanied by Capitan Tiago and Aunt Isabel, while Maria Clara shut herself up in the oratory.\n“Please tell Andeng to get the house ready, as Maria and Isabel are coming. A pleasant journey!” said Capitan Tiago as Ibarra stepped into the carriage, which at once started in the direction of the plaza of San Gabriel.\nAfterwards, by way of consolation, her father said to Maria Clara, who was weeping beside an image of the Virgin, “Come, light two candles worth two reals each, one to St. Roch,[2] and one to St. Raphael, the protector of travelers. Light the lamp of Our Lady of Peace and Prosperous Voyages, since there are so many tulisanes. It’s better to spend four reals for wax and six cuartos for oil now than to pay a big ransom later.”\n 1 The “Ateneo Municipal,” where the author, as well as nearly every other Filipino of note in the past generation, received his early education, was founded by the Jesuits shortly after their return to the islands in 1859.—TR.\n2 The patron saint of Tondo, Manila’s Saint-Antoine.

The movement in every part, so many carriages coming and going at full speed, the carromatas and calesas, the Europeans, the Chinese, the natives, each in his own peculiar costume, the fruit-venders, the money-changers, the naked porters, the grocery stores, the lunch stands and restaurants, the shops, and even the carts drawn by the impassive and indifferent carabao, who seems to amuse himself in carrying burdens while he patiently ruminates, all this noise and confusion, the very sun itself, the distinctive odors and the motley colors, awoke in the youth’s mind a world of sleeping recollections.\nThose streets had not yet been paved, and two successive days of sunshine filled them with dust which covered everything and made the passer-by cough while it nearly blinded him. A day of rain formed pools of muddy water, which at night reflected the carriage lights and splashed mud a distance of several yards away upon the pedestrians on the narrow sidewalks. And how many women have left their embroidered slippers in those waves of mud!\nThen there might have been seen repairing those streets the lines of convicts with their shaven heads, dressed in short-sleeved camisas and pantaloons that reached only to their knees, each with his letter and number in blue. On their legs were chains partly wrapped in dirty rags to ease the chafing or perhaps the chill of the iron. Joined two by two, scorched in the sun, worn out by the heat and fatigue, they were lashed and goaded by a whip in the hands of one of their own number, who perhaps consoled himself with this power of maltreating others. They were tall men with somber faces, which he had never seen brightened with the light of a smile. Yet their eyes gleamed when the whistling lash fell upon their shoulders or when a passer-by threw them the chewed and broken stub of a cigar, which the nearest would snatch up and hide in his salakot, while the rest remained gazing at the passers-by with strange looks.\nThe noise of the stones being crushed to fill the puddles and the merry clank of the heavy fetters on the swollen ankles seemed to remain with Ibarra. He shuddered as he recalled a scene that had made a deep impression on his childish imagination. It was a hot afternoon, and the burning rays of the sun fell perpendicularly upon a large cart by the side of which was stretched out one of those unfortunates, lifeless, yet with his eyes half opened. Two others were silently preparing a bamboo bier, showing no signs of anger or sorrow or impatience, for such is the character attributed to the natives: today it is you, tomorrow it will be I, they say to themselves. The people moved rapidly about without giving heed, women came up and after a look of curiosity continued unconcerned on their way—it was such a common sight that their hearts had become callous. Carriages passed, flashing back from their varnished sides the rays of the sun that burned in a cloudless sky. Only he, a child of eleven years and fresh from the country, was moved, and to him alone it brought bad dreams on the following night.\nThere no longer existed the useful and honored Puente de Barcas, the good Filipino pontoon bridge that had done its best to be of service in spite of its natural imperfections and its rising and falling at the caprice of the Pasig, which had more than once abused it and finally destroyed it. The almond trees in the plaza of San Gabriel[1] had not grown; they were still in the same feeble and stunted condition. The Escolta appeared less beautiful in spite of the fact that an imposing building with caryatids carved on its front now occupied the place of the old row of shops. The new Bridge of Spain caught his attention, while the houses on the right bank of the river among the clumps of bamboo and trees where the Escolta ends and the Isla de Romero begins, reminded him of the cool mornings when he used to pass there in a boat on his way to the baths of Uli-Uli.\nHe met many carriages, drawn by beautiful pairs of dwarfish ponies, within which were government clerks who seemed yet half asleep as they made their way to their offices, or military officers, or Chinese in foolish and ridiculous attitudes, or Gave friars and canons. In an elegant victoria he thought he recognized Padre Damaso, grave and frowning, but he had already passed. Now he was pleasantly greeted by Capitan Tinong, who was passing in a carretela with his wife and two daughters.\nAs they went down off the bridge the horses broke into a trot along the Sabana Drive.[2] On the left the Arroceros Cigar Factory resounded with the noise of the cigar-makers pounding the tobacco leaves, and Ibarra was unable to restrain a smile as he thought of the strong odor which about five o’clock in the afternoon used to float all over the Puente de Barcas and which had made him sick when he was a child. The lively conversations and the repartee of the crowds from the cigar factories carried him back to the district of Lavapiés in Madrid, with its riots of cigar-makers, so fatal for the unfortunate policemen.\nThe Botanical Garden drove away these agreeable recollections; the demon of comparison brought before his mind the Botanical Gardens of Europe, in countries where great, labor and much money are needed to make a single leaf grow or one flower open its calyx; he recalled those of the colonies, where they are well supplied and tended, and all open to the public. Ibarra turned away his gaze toward the old Manila surrounded still by its walls and moats like a sickly girl wrapped in the garments of her grandmother’s better days.\nThen the sight of the sea losing itself in the distance! “On the other shore lies Europe,” thought the young man,—“Europe, with its attractive peoples in constant movement in the search for happiness, weaving their dreams in the morning and disillusioning themselves at the setting of the sun, happy even in the midst of their calamities. Yes, on the farther shore of the boundless sea are the really spiritual nations, those who, even though they put no restraints on material development, are still more spiritual than those who pride themselves on adoring only the spirit!”\nBut these musings were in turn banished from his mind as he came in sight of the little mound in Bagumbayan Field.[3] This isolated knoll at the side of the Luneta now caught his attention and made him reminiscent. He thought of the man who had awakened his intellect and made him understand goodness and justice. The ideas which that man had impressed upon him were not many, to be sure, but they were not meaningless repetitions, they were convictions which had not paled in the light of the most brilliant foci of progress. That man was an old priest whose words of farewell still resounded in his ears: “Do [64]not forget that if knowledge is the heritage of mankind, it is only the courageous who inherit it,” he had reminded him. “I have tried to pass on to you what I got from my teachers, the sum of which I have endeavored to increase and transmit to the coming generation as far as in me lay. You will now do the same for those who come after you, and you can treble it, since you are going to rich countries.” Then he had added with a smile, “They come here seeking wealth, go you to their country to seek also that other wealth which we lack! But remember that all that glitters is not gold.” The old man had died on that spot.\nAt these recollections the youth murmured audibly: “No, in spite of everything, the fatherland first, first the Philippines, the child of Spain, first the Spanish fatherland! No, that which is decreed by fate does not tarnish the honor of the fatherland, no!”\nHe gave little heed to Ermita, the phenix of nipa that had rearisen from its ashes under the form of blue and white houses with red-painted roofs of corrugated iron. Nor was his attention caught by Malate, neither by the cavalry barracks with the spreading trees in front, nor by the inhabitants or their little nipa huts, pyramidal or prismatic in shape, hidden away among the banana plants and areca palms, constructed like nests by each father of a family.\nThe carriage continued on its way, meeting now and then carromatas drawn by one or two ponies whose abaka harness indicated that they were from the country. The drivers would try to catch a glimpse of the occupant of the fine carriage, but would pass on without exchanging a word, without a single salute. At times a heavy cart drawn by a slow and indifferent carabao would appear on the dusty road over which beat the brilliant sunlight of the tropics. The mournful and monotonous song of the driver mounted on the back of the carabao would be mingled at one time with the screechings of a dry wheel on the huge axle of the heavy vehicle or at another time with the dull scraping of worn-out runners on a sledge which was dragged heavily through the dust, and over the ruts in the road. In the fields and wide meadows the herds were grazing, attended ever by the white buffalo-birds which roosted peacefully on the backs of the animals while these chewed their cuds or browsed in lazy contentment upon the rich grass. In the distance ponies frisked, jumping and running about, pursued by the lively colts with long tails and abundant manes who whinnied and pawed the ground with their hard hoofs.\nLet us leave the youth dreaming or dozing, since neither the sad nor the animated poetry of the open country held his attention. For him there was no charm in the sun that gleamed upon the tops of the trees and caused the rustics, with feet burned by the hot ground in spite of their callousness, to hurry along, or that made the villager pause beneath the shade of an almond tree or a bamboo brake while he pondered upon vague and inexplicable things. While the youth’s carriage sways along like a drunken thing on account of the inequalities in the surface of the road when passing over a bamboo bridge or going up an incline or descending a steep slope, let us return to Manila.\n 1 Now Plaza Cervantes.—TR.\n2 Now Plaza Lawton and Bagumbayan; see note, infra.— TR.\n3 The Field of Bagumbayan, adjoining the Luneta, was the place where political prisoners were shot or garroted, and was the scene of the author’s execution on December 30, 1906. It is situated just outside and east of the old Walled City (Manila proper), being the location to which the natives who had occupied the site of Manila moved their town after having been driven back by the Spaniards—hence the name, which is a Tagalog compound meaning “new town.” This place is now called Wallace Field, the name Bagumbayan being applied to the driveway which was known to the Spaniards as the Paseo de las Aguadas, or de Vidal, extending from the Luneta to the Bridge of Spain, just outside the moat that, formerly encircled the Walled City.—TR.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-viii-recollections/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter IX – Local Affairs Ibarra had not been mistaken about the occupant of the victoria, for it was indeed Padre Damaso, and he was on his way to the house which the youth had just left.\n“Where are you going?” asked the friar of Maria Clara and Aunt Isabel, who were about to enter a silver-mounted carriage. In the midst of his preoccupation Padre Damaso stroked the maiden’s cheek lightly.\n“To the convent to get my things,” answered the latter.\n“Ahaa! Aha! We’ll see who’s stronger, we’ll see,” muttered the friar abstractedly, as with bowed head and slow step he turned to the stairway, leaving the two women not a little amazed.\n“He must have a sermon to preach and is memorizing it,” commented Aunt Isabel. “Get in, Maria, or we’ll be late.”\nWhether or not Padre Damaso was preparing a sermon we cannot say, but it is certain that some grave matter filled his mind, for he did not extend his hand to Capitan Tiago, who had almost to get down on his knees to kiss it.\n“Santiago,” said the friar at once, “I have an important matter to talk to you about. Let’s go into your office.”\nCapitan Tiago began to feel uneasy, so much so that he did not know what to say; but he obeyed, following the heavy figure of the priest, who closed the door behind him.\nWhile they confer in secret, let us learn what Fray Sibyla has been doing. The astute Dominican is not at the rectory, for very soon after celebrating mass he had gone to the convent of his order, situated just inside the gate of Isabel II, or of Magellan, according to what family happened to be reigning in Madrid. Without paying any attention to the rich odor of chocolate, or to the rattle of boxes and coins which came from the treasury, and scarcely acknowledging the respectful and deferential salute of the procurator-brother, he entered, passed along several corridors, and knocked at a door.\n“Come in,” sighed a weak voice.\n“May God restore health to your Reverence,” was the young Dominican’s greeting as he entered.\nSeated in a large armchair was an aged priest, wasted and rather sallow, like the saints that Rivera painted. His eyes were sunken in their hollow sockets, over which his heavy eyebrows were almost always contracted, thus accentuating their brilliant gleam. Padre Sibyla, with his arms crossed under the venerable scapulary of St. Dominic, gazed at him feelingly, then bowed his head and waited in silence.\n“Ah,” sighed the old man, “they advise an operation, an operation, Hernando, at my age! This country, O this terrible country! Take warning from my ease, Hernando!”\nFray Sibyla raised his eyes slowly and fixed them on the sick man’s face. “What has your Reverence decided to do?” he asked.\n“To die! Ah, what else can I do? I am suffering too much, but—I have made many suffer, I am paying my debt! And how are you? What has brought you here?”\n“I’ve come to talk about the business which you committed to my care.”\n“Ah! What about it?”\n“Pish!” answered the young man disgustedly, as he seated himself and turned away his face with a contemptuous expression, “They’ve been telling us fairy tales. Young Ibarra is a youth of discernment; he doesn’t seem to be a fool, but I believe that he is a good lad.”\n“You believe so?”\n“Hostilities began last night.”\n“Already? How?”\nFray Sibyla then recounted briefly what had taken place between Padre Damaso and Ibarra. “Besides,” he said in conclusion, “the young man is going to marry Capitan Tiago’s daughter, who was educated in the college of our Sisterhood. He’s rich, and won’t care to make enemies and to run the risk of ruining his fortune and his happiness.”\nThe sick man nodded in agreement. “Yes, I think as you do. With a wife like that and such a father-in-law, we’ll own him body and soul. If not, so much the better for him to declare himself an enemy of ours.”\nFray Sibyla looked at the old man in surprise.\n“For the good of our holy Order, I mean, of course,” he added, breathing heavily. “I prefer open attacks to the silly praises and flatteries of friends, which are really paid for.”\n“Does your Reverence think—”\nThe old man regarded him sadly. “Keep it clearly before you,” he answered, gasping for breath. “Our power will last as long as it is believed in. If they attack us, the government will say, ‘They attack them because they see in them an obstacle to their liberty, so then let us preserve them.’”\n“But if it should listen to them? Sometimes the government—”\n“It will not listen!”\n“Nevertheless, if, led on by cupidity, it should come to wish for itself what we are taking in—if there should be some bold and daring one—”\n“Then woe unto that one!”\nBoth remained silent for a time, then the sick man continued: “Besides, we need their attacks, to keep us awake; that makes us see our weaknesses so that we may remedy them. Exaggerated flattery will deceive us and put us to sleep, while outside our walls we shall be laughed at, and the day in which we become an object of ridicule, we shall fall as we fell in Europe. Money will not flow into our churches, no one will buy our scapularies or girdles or anything else, and when we cease to be rich we shall no longer be able to control consciences.”\n“But we shall always have our estates, our property.”\n“All will be lost as we lost them in Europe! And the worst of it is that we are working toward our own ruin. For example, this unrestrained eagerness to raise arbitrarily the rents on our lands each year, this eagerness which I have so vainly combated in all the chapters, this will ruin us! The native sees himself obliged to purchase farms in other places, which bring him as good returns as ours, or better. I fear that we are already on the decline; quos vult perdere Jupiter dementat prius.[1] For this reason we should not increase our burden; the people are already murmuring. You have decided well: let us leave the others to settle their accounts in that quarter; let us preserve the prestige that remains to us, and as we shall soon appear before God, let us wash our hands of it—and may the God of mercy have pity on our weakness!”\n“So your Reverence thinks that the rent or tax—”\n“Let’s not talk any more about money,” interrupted the sick man with signs of disgust. “You say that the lieutenant threatened to Padre Damaso that—”\n“Yes, Padre,” broke in Fray Sibyla with a faint smile, “but this morning I saw him and he told me that he was sorry for what occurred last night, that the sherry had gone to his head, and that he believed that Padre Damaso was in the same condition. ‘And your threat?’ I asked him jokingly. ‘Padre,’ he answered me, ‘I know how to keep my word when my honor is affected, but I am not nor have ever been an informer—for that reason I wear only two stars.’”\nAfter they had conversed a while longer on unimportant subjects, Fray Sibyla took his departure.\nIt was true that the lieutenant had not gone to the Palace, but the Captain-General heard what had occurred. While talking with some of his aides about the allusions that the Manila newspapers were making to him under the names of comets and celestial apparitions, one of them told him about the affair of Padre Damaso, with a somewhat heightened coloring although substantially correct as to matter.\n“From whom did you learn this?” asked his Excellency, smiling.\n“From Laruja, who was telling it this morning in the office.”\nThe Captain-General again smiled and said: “A woman or a friar can’t insult one. I contemplate living in peace for the time that I shall remain in this country and I don’t want any more quarrels with men who wear skirts. Besides, I’ve learned that the Provincial has scoffed at my orders. I asked for the removal of this friar as a punishment and they transferred him to a better town ‘monkish tricks,’ as we say in Spain.”\nBut when his Excellency found himself alone he stopped smiling. “Ah, if this people were not so stupid, I would put a curb on their Reverences,” he sighed to himself. “But every people deserves its fate, so let’s do as everybody else does.”\nCapitan Tiago, meanwhile, had concluded his interview with Padre Damaso, or rather, to speak more exactly, Padre Damaso had concluded with him.\n“So now you are warned!” said the Franciscan on leaving. “All this could have been avoided if you had consulted me beforehand, if you had not lied when I asked you. Try not to play any more foolish tricks, and trust your protector.”\nCapitan Tiago walked up and down the sala a few times, meditating and sighing. Suddenly, as if a happy thought had occurred to him, he ran to the oratory and extinguished the candles and the lamp that had been lighted for Ibarra’s safety. “The way is long and there’s yet time,” he muttered.\n 1 Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.—TR.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-ix-local-affairs/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter X – The Town Almost on the margin of the lake, in the midst of meadows and paddy-fields, lies the town of San Diego.[1] From it sugar, rice, coffee, and fruits are either exported or sold for a small part of their value to the Chinese, who exploit the simplicity and vices of the native farmers.\nWhen on a clear day the boys ascend to the upper part of the church tower, which is beautified by moss and creeping plants, they break out into joyful exclamations at the beauty of the scene spread out before them. In the midst of the clustering roofs of nipa, tiles, corrugated iron, and palm leaves, separated by groves and gardens, each one is able to discover his own home, his little nest. Everything serves as a mark: a tree, that tamarind with its light foliage, that coco palm laden with nuts, like the Astarte Genetrix, or the Diana of Ephesus with her numerous breasts, a bending bamboo, an areca palm, or a cross. Yonder is the river, a huge glassy serpent sleeping on a green carpet, with rocks, scattered here and there along its sandy channel, that break its current into ripples. There, the bed is narrowed between high banks to which the gnarled trees cling with bared roots; here, it becomes a gentle slope where the stream widens and eddies about. Farther away, a small hut built on the edge of the high bank seems to defy the winds, the heights and the depths, presenting with its slender posts the appearance of a huge, long-legged bird watching for a reptile to seize upon. Trunks of palm or other trees with their bark still on them unite the banks by a shaky and infirm foot-bridge which, if not a very secure crossing, is nevertheless a wonderful contrivance for gymnastic exercises in preserving one’s balance, a thing not to be despised. The boys bathing in the river are amused by the difficulties of the old woman crossing with a basket on her head or by the antics of the old man who moves tremblingly and loses his staff in the water.\nBut that which always attracts particular notice is what might be called a peninsula of forest in the sea of cultivated fields. There in that wood are century-old trees with hollow trunks, which die only when their high tops are struck and set on fire by the lightning—and it is said that the fire always checks itself and dies out in the same spot. There are huge points of rock which time and nature are clothing with velvet garments of moss. Layer after layer of dust settles in the hollows, the rains beat it down, and the birds bring seeds. The tropical vegetation spreads out luxuriantly in thickets and underbrush, while curtains of interwoven vines hang from the branches of the trees and twine about their roots or spread along the ground, as if Flora were not yet satisfied but must place plant above plant. Mosses and fungi live upon the cracked trunks, and orchids—graceful guests—twine in loving embrace with the foliage of the hospitable trees.\nStrange legends exist concerning this wood, which is held in awe by the country folk. The most credible account, and therefore the one least known and believed, seems to be this. When the town was still a collection of miserable huts with the grass growing abundantly in the so-called streets, at the time when the wild boar and deer roamed about during the nights, there arrived in the place one day an old, hollow-eyed Spaniard, who spoke Tagalog rather well. After looking about and inspecting the land, he finally inquired for the owners of this wood, in which there were hot springs. Some persons who claimed to be such presented themselves, and the old man acquired it in exchange for clothes, jewels, and a sum of money. Soon afterward he disappeared mysteriously. The people thought that he had been spirited away, when a bad odor from the neighboring wood attracted the attention of some herdsmen. Tracing this, they found the decaying corpse of the old Spaniard hanging from the branch of a balete tree.[2] In life he had inspired fear by his deep, hollow voice, his sunken eyes, and his mirthless laugh, but now, dead by his own act, he disturbed the sleep of the women. Some threw the jewels into the river and burned the clothes, and from the time that the corpse was buried at the foot of the balete itself, no one willingly ventured near the spot. A belated herdsman looking for some of his strayed charges told of lights that he had seen there, and when some venturesome youths went to the place they heard mournful cries. To win the smiles of his disdainful lady, a forlorn lover agreed to spend the night there and in proof to wrap around the trunk a long piece of rattan, but he died of a quick fever that seized him the very next day. Stories and legends still cluster about the place.\nA few months after the finding of the old Spaniard’s body there appeared a youth, apparently a Spanish mestizo, who said that he was the son of the deceased. He established himself in the place and devoted his attention to agriculture, especially the raising of indigo. Don Saturnino was a silent young man with a violent disposition, even cruel at times, yet he was energetic and industrious. He surrounded the grave of his father with a wall, but visited it only at rare intervals. When he was along in years, he married a young woman from Manila, and she became the mother of Don Rafael, the father of Crisostomo. From his youth Don Rafael was a favorite with the country people. The agricultural methods introduced and encouraged by his father spread rapidly, new settlers poured in, the Chinese came, and the settlement became a village with a native priest. Later the village grew into a town, the priest died, and Fray Damaso came.\nAll this time the tomb and the land around it remained unmolested. Sometimes a crowd of boys armed with clubs and stones would become bold enough to wander into the place to gather guavas, papayas, lomboy, and other fruits, but it frequently happened that when their sport was at its height, or while they gazed in awed silence at the rotting piece of rope which still swung from the branch, stones would fall, coming from they knew not where. Then with cries of “The old man! The old man!” they would throw away fruit and clubs, jump from the trees, and hurry between the rocks and through the thickets; nor would they stop running until they were well out of the wood, some pale and breathless, others weeping, and only a few laughing.\n 1 We have been unable to find any town of this name, but many of these conditions.—Author’s note.\nSan Diego and Santiago are variant forms of the name of the patron saint of Spain, St. James.—TR.\n2 The “sacred tree” of Malaya, being a species of banyan that begins life as a vine twining on another tree, which it finally strangles, using the dead trunk as a support until it is able to stand alone. When old it often covers a large space with gnarled and twisted trunks of varied shapes and sizes, thus presenting a weird and grotesque appearance. This tree was held in reverent awe by the primitive Filipinos, who believed it to be the abode of the nono, or ancestral ghosts, and is still the object of superstitious beliefs,—TR.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-x-the-town/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter XI – The Rulers  Divide and rule.\n (The New Machiavelli)\nWho were the caciques of the town?\nDon Rafael, when alive, even though he was the richest, owned more land, and was the patron of nearly everybody, had not been one of them. As he was modest and depreciated the value of his own deeds, no faction in his favor had ever been formed in the town, and we have already seen how the people all rose up against him when they saw him hesitate upon being attacked.\nCould it be Capitan Tiago? True it was that when he went there he was received with an orchestra by his debtors, who banqueted him and heaped gifts upon him. The finest fruits burdened his table and a quarter of deer or wild boar was his share of the hunt. If he found the horse of a debtor beautiful, half an hour afterwards it was in his stable. All this was true, but they laughed at him behind his back and in secret called him “Sacristan Tiago.”\nPerhaps it was the gobernadorcillo?1 No, for he was only an unhappy mortal who commanded not, but obeyed; who ordered not, but was ordered; who drove not, but was driven. Nevertheless, he had to answer to the alcalde for having commanded, ordered, and driven, just as if he were the originator of everything. Yet be it said to his credit that he had never presumed upon or usurped such honors, which had cost him five thousand pesos and many humiliations. But considering the income it brought him, it was cheap.\nWell then, might it be God? Ah, the good God disturbed neither the consciences nor the sleep of the inhabitants. At least, He did not make them tremble, and if by chance He might have been mentioned in a sermon, surely they would have sighed longingly, “Oh, that only there were a God!” To the good Lord they paid little attention, as the saints gave them enough to do. For those poor folk God had come to be like those unfortunate monarchs who are surrounded by courtiers to whom alone the people render homage.\nSan Diego was a kind of Rome: not the Rome of the time when the cunning Romulus laid out its walls with a plow, nor of the later time when, bathed in its own and others’ blood, it dictated laws to the world—no, it was a Rome of our own times with the difference that in place of marble monuments and colosseums it had its monuments of sawali and its cockpit of nipa. The curate was the Pope in the Vatican; the alferez of the Civil Guard, the King of Italy on the Quirinal: all, it must be understood, on a scale of nipa and bamboo. Here, as there, continual quarreling went on, since each wished to be the master and considered the other an intruder. Let us examine the characteristics of each.\nFray Bernardo Salvi was that silent young Franciscan of whom we have spoken before. In his habits and manners he was quite different from his brethren and even from his predecessor, the violent Padre Damaso. He was thin and sickly, habitually pensive, strict in the fulfilment of his religious duties, and careful of his good name. In a month after his arrival nearly every one in the town had joined the Venerable Tertiary Order, to the great distress of its rival, the Society of the Holy Rosary. His soul leaped with joy to see about each neck four or five scapularies and around each waist a knotted girdle, and to behold the procession of corpses and ghosts in guingón habits. The senior sacristan made a small fortune selling—or giving away as alms, we should say—all things necessary for the salvation of the soul and the warfare against the devil, as it is well known that this spirit, which formerly had the temerity to contradict God himself face to face and to doubt His words, as is related in the holy book of Job, who carried our Lord Christ through the air as afterwards in the Dark Ages he carried the ghosts, and continues, according to report, to carry the asuang of the Philippines, now seems to have become so shamefaced that he cannot endure the sight of a piece of painted cloth and that he fears the knots on a cord. But all this proves nothing more than that there is progress on this side also and that the devil is backward, or at least a conservative, as are all who dwell in darkness. Otherwise, we must attribute to him the weakness of a fifteen-year-old girl.\nAs we have said, Fray Salvi was very assiduous in the fulfilment of his duties, too assiduous, the alferez thought. While he was preaching—he was very fond of preaching—the doors of the church were closed, wherein he was like Nero, who allowed no one to leave the theater while he was singing. But the former did it for the salvation and the latter for the corruption of souls. Fray Salvi rarely resorted to blows, but was accustomed to punish every shortcoming of his subordinates with fines. In this respect he was very different from Padre Damaso, who had been accustomed to settle everything with his fists or a cane, administering such chastisement with the greatest good-will. For this, however, he should not be judged too harshly, as he was firm in the belief that the Indian could be managed only by beating him, just as was affirmed by a friar who knew enough to write books, and Padre Damaso never disputed anything that he saw in print, a credulity of which many might have reason to complain. Although Fray Salvi made little use of violence, yet, as an old wiseacre of the town said, what he lacked in quantity he made up in quality. But this should not be counted against him, for the fasts and abstinences thinned his blood and unstrung his nerves and, as the people said, the wind got into his head. Thus it came about that it was not possible to learn from the condition of the sacristans’ backs whether the curate was fasting or feasting.\nThe only rival of this spiritual power, with tendencies toward the temporal, was, as we have said, the alferez: the only one, since the women told how the devil himself would flee from the curate, because, having one day dared to tempt him, he was caught, tied to a bedpost, soundly whipped with a rope, and set at liberty only after nine days. As a consequence, any one who after this would still be the enemy of such a man, deserved to fall into worse repute than even the weak and unwary devils.\nBut the alferez deserved his fate. His wife was an old Filipina of abundant rouge and paint, known as Doña Consolacion—although her husband and some others called her by quite another name. The alferez revenged his conjugal misfortunes on his own person by getting so drunk that he made a tank of himself, or by ordering his soldiers to drill in the sun while he remained in the shade, or, more frequently, by beating up his consort, who, if she was not a lamb of God to take away one’s sins, at least served to lay up for her spouse many torments in Purgatory—if perchance he should get there, a matter of doubt to the devout women. As if for the fun of it, these two used to beat each other up beautifully, giving free shows to the neighborhood with vocal and instrumental accompaniments, four-handed, soft, loud, with pedal and all.\nWhenever these scandals reached the ears of Padre Salvi, he would smile, cross himself, and recite a paternoster. They called him a grafter, a hypocrite, a Carlist, and a miser: he merely smiled and recited more prayers. The alferez had a little anecdote which he always related to the occasional Spaniards who visited him:\n“Are you going over to the convento to visit the sanctimonious rascal there, the little curate? Yes! Well, if he offers you chocolate which I doubt—but if he offers it remember this: if he calls to the servant and says, ‘Juan, make a cup of chocolate, eh!’ then stay without fear; but if he calls out, ‘Juan, make a cup of chocolate, ah!’ then take your hat and leave on a run.”\n“What!” the startled visitor would ask, “does he poison people? Carambas!”\n“No, man, not at all!”\n“What then?”\n“‘Chocolate, eh!’ means thick and rich, while ‘chocolate, ah!’ means watered and thin.”\nBut we are of the opinion that this was a slander on the part of the alferez, since the same story is told of many curates. At least, it may be a thing peculiar to the Order.\nTo make trouble for the curate, the soldier, at the instigation of his wife, would prohibit any one from walking abroad after nine o’clock at night. Doña Consolacion would then claim that she had seen the curate, disguised in a piña camisa and salakot, walking about late. Fray Salvi would take his revenge in a holy manner. Upon seeing the alferez enter the church he would innocently order the sacristan to close all the doors, and would then go up into the pulpit and preach until the very saints closed their eyes and even the wooden dove above his head, the image of the Holy Ghost, murmured for mercy. But the alferez, like all the unregenerate, did not change his ways for this; he would go away cursing, and as soon as he was able to catch a sacristan, or one of the curate’s servants, he would arrest him, give him a beating, and make him scrub the floor of the barracks and that of his own house, which at such times was put in a decent condition. On going to pay the fine imposed by the curate for his absence, the sacristan would explain the cause. Fray Salvi would listen in silence, take the money, and at once turn out his goats and sheep so that they might graze in the alferez’s garden, while he himself looked up a new text for another longer and more edifying sermon. But these were only little pleasantries, and if the two chanced to meet they would shake hands and converse politely.\nWhen her husband was sleeping off the wine he had drunk, or was snoring through the siesta, and she could not quarrel with him, Doña Consolacion, in a blue flannel camisa, with a big cigar in her mouth, would take her stand at the window. She could not endure the young people, so from there she would scrutinize and mock the passing girls, who, being afraid of her, would hurry by in confusion, holding their breath the while, and not daring to raise their eyes. One great virtue Doña Consolation possessed, and this was that she had evidently never looked in a mirror.\nThese were the rulers of the town of San Diego.\n 1 “Petty governor,” the chief municipal official, chosen annually from among their own number, with the approval of the parish priest and the central government, by the principalía, i.e., persons who owned considerable property or who had previously held some municipal office. The manner of his selection is thus described by a German traveler (Jagor) in the Philippines in 1860: “The election is held in the town hall. The governor or his representative presides, having on his right the parish priest and on his left a clerk, who also acts as interpreter. All the cabezas de barangay, the gobernadorcillo, and those who have formerly occupied the latter position, seat themselves on benches. First, there are chosen by lot six cabezas de barangay and six ex-gobernadorcillos as electors, the actual gobernadorcillo being the thirteenth. The rest leave the hall. After the presiding officer has read the statutes in a loud voice and reminded the electors of their duty to act in accordance with their consciences and to heed only the welfare of the town, the electors move to a table and write three names on a slip of paper. The person receiving a majority of votes is declared elected gobernadorcillo for the ensuing year, provided that there is no protest from the curate or the electors, and always conditioned upon the approval of the superior authority in Manila, which is never withheld, since the influence of the curate is enough to prevent an unsatisfactory election.”—TR.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-xi-the-rulers/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter XII – All Saints The one thing perhaps that indisputably distinguishes man from the brute creation is the attention which he pays to those who have passed away and, wonder of wonders! this characteristic seems to be more deeply rooted in proportion to the lack of civilization. Historians relate that the ancient inhabitants of the Philippines venerated and deified their ancestors; but now the contrary is true, and the dead have to entrust themselves to the living. It is also related that the people of New Guinea preserve the bones of their dead in chests and maintain communication with them. The greater part of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and America offer them the finest products of their kitchens or dishes of what was their favorite food when alive, and give banquets at which they believe them to be present. The Egyptians raised up palaces and the Mussulmans built shrines, but the masters in these things, those who have most clearly read the human heart, are the people of Dahomey. These negroes know that man is revengeful, so they consider that nothing will more content the dead than to sacrifice all his enemies upon his grave, and, as man is curious and may not know how to entertain himself in the other life, each year they send him a newsletter under the skin of a beheaded slave.\nWe ourselves differ from all the rest. In spite of the inscriptions on the tombs, hardly any one believes that the dead rest, and much less, that they rest in peace. The most optimistic fancies his forefathers still roasting in purgatory and, if it turns out that he himself be not completely damned, he will yet be able to associate with them for many [83]years. If any one would contradict let him visit the churches and cemeteries of the country on All Saints’ day and he will be convinced.\nNow that we are in San Diego let us visit its cemetery, which is located in the midst of paddy-fields, there toward the west—not a city, merely a village of the dead, approached by a path dusty in dry weather and navigable on rainy days. A wooden gate and a fence half of stone and half of bamboo stakes, appear to separate it from the abode of the living but not from the curate’s goats and some of the pigs of the neighborhood, who come and go making explorations among the tombs and enlivening the solitude with their presence. In the center of this enclosure rises a large wooden cross set on a stone pedestal. The storms have doubled over the tin plate for the inscription INRI, and the rains have effaced the letters. At the foot of the cross, as on the real Golgotha, is a confused heap of skulls and bones which the indifferent grave-digger has thrown from the graves he digs, and there they will probably await, not the resurrection of the dead, but the coming of the animals to defile them. Round about may be noted signs of recent excavations; here the earth is sunken, there it forms a low mound. There grow in all their luxuriance the tarambulo to prick the feet with its spiny berries and the pandakaki to add its odor to that of the cemetery, as if the place did not have smells enough already. Yet the ground is sprinkled with a few little flowers which, like those skulls, are known only to their Creator; their petals wear a pale smile and their fragrance is the fragrance of the tombs. The grass and creepers fill up the corners or climb over the walls and niches to cover and beautify the naked ugliness and in places even penetrate into the fissures made by the earthquakes, so as to hide from sight the revered hollowness of the sepulcher.\nAt the time we enter, the people have driven the animals away, with the single exception of some old hog, an animal that is hard to convince, who shows his small eyes and [84]pulling back his head from a great gap in the fence, sticks up his snout and seems to say to a woman praying near, “Don’t eat it all, leave something for me, won’t you?”\nTwo men are digging a grave near one of the tottering walls. One of them, the grave-digger, works with indifference, throwing about bones as a gardener does stones and dry branches, while the other, more intent on his work, is perspiring, smoking, and spitting at every moment.\n“Listen,” says the latter in Tagalog, “wouldn’t it be better for us to dig in some other place? This is too recent.”\n“One grave is as recent as another.”\n“I can’t stand it any longer! That bone you’re just cut in two has blood oozing from it—and those hairs?”\n“But how sensitive you are!” was the other’s reproach. “Just as if you were a town clerk! If, like myself, you had dug up a corpse of twenty days, on a dark and rainy night—! My lantern went out—”\nHis companion shuddered.\n“The coffin burst open, the corpse fell half-way out, it stunk—and supposing you had to carry it—the rain wet us both—”\n“Ugh! And why did you dig it up?”\nThe grave-digger looked at him in surprise. “Why? How do I know? I was ordered to do so.”\n“Who ordered you?”\nThe grave-digger stepped backward and looked his companion over from head to foot. “Man, you’re like a Spaniard, for afterwards a Spaniard asked me the same questions, but in secret. So I’m going to answer you as I answered the Spaniard: the fat curate ordered me to do so.”\n“Ah! And what did you do with the corpse afterwards?” further questioned the sensitive one.\n“The devil! If I didn’t know you and was not sure that you are a man I would say that you were certainly a Spaniard of the Civil Guard, since you ask questions just as he did. Well, the fat curate ordered me to bury it in the Chinamen’s cemetery, but the coffin was heavy and the Chinese cemetery far away—”\n“No, no! I’m not going to dig any more!” the other interrupted in horror as he threw away his spade and jumped out of the hole. “I’ve cut a skull in two and I’m afraid that it won’t let me sleep tonight.” The old grave-digger laughed to see how the chicken-hearted fellow left, crossing himself.\nThe cemetery was filling up with men and women dressed in mourning. Some sought a grave for a time, disputing among themselves the while, and as if they were unable to agree, they scattered about, each kneeling where he thought best. Others, who had niches for their deceased relatives, lighted candles and fell to praying devoutly. Exaggerated or suppressed sighs and sobs were heard amid the hum of prayers, orapreo, orapreiss, requiem-aeternams, that arose from all sides.\nA little old man with bright eyes entered bareheaded. Upon seeing him many laughed, and some women knitted their eyebrows. The old man did not seem to pay any attention to these demonstrations as he went toward a pile of skulls and knelt to look earnestly for something among the bones. Then he carefully removed the skulls one by one, but apparently without finding what he sought, for he wrinkled his brow, nodded his head from side to side, looked all about him, and finally rose and approached the grave-digger, who raised his head when the old man spoke to him.\n“Do you know where there is a beautiful skull, white as the meat of a coconut, with a complete set of teeth, which I had there at the foot of the cross under those leaves?”\nThe grave-digger shrugged his shoulders.\n“Look!” added the old man, showing a silver coin, “I have only this, but I’ll give it to you if you find the skull for me.”\nThe gleam of the silver caused the grave-digger to consider, and staring toward the heap of bones he said, “Isn’t it there? No? Then I don’t know where it is.”\n“Don’t you know? When those who owe me pay me, I’ll give you more,” continued the old man. “It was the skull of my wife, so if you find it for me—”\n“Isn’t it there? Then I don’t know! But if you wish, I can give you another.”\n“You’re like the grave you’re digging,” apostrophized the old man nervously. “You don’t know the value of what you lose. For whom is that grave?”\n“How should I know?” replied the other in bad humor.\n“For a corpse!”\n“Like the grave, like the grave!” repeated the old man with a dry smile. “You don’t know what you throw away nor what you receive! Dig, dig on!” And he turned away in the direction of the gate.\nMeanwhile, the grave-digger had completed his task, attested by the two mounds of fresh red earth at the sides of the grave. He took some buyo from his salakot and began to chew it while he stared stupidly at what was going on around him.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-xii-all-saints/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter XIII – Signs of Storm As the old man was leaving the cemetery there stopped at the head of the path a carriage which, from its dust-covered appearance and sweating horses, seemed to have come from a great distance. Followed by an aged servant, Ibarra left the carriage and dismissed it with a wave of his hand, then gravely and silently turned toward the cemetery.\n“My illness and my duties have not permitted me to return,” said the old servant timidly. “Capitan Tiago promised that he would see that a niche was constructed, but I planted some flowers on the grave and set up a cross carved by my own hands.” Ibarra made no reply. “There behind that big cross, sir,” he added when they were well inside the gate, as he pointed to the place.\nIbarra was so intent upon his quest that he did not notice the movement of surprise on the part of the persons who recognized him and suspended their prayers to watch him curiously. He walked along carefully to avoid stepping on any of the graves, which were easily distinguishable by the hollow places in the soil. In other times he had walked on them carelessly, but now they were to be respected: his father lay among them. When he reached the large cross he stopped and looked all around. His companion stood confused and confounded, seeking some mark in the ground, but nowhere was any cross to be seen.\n“Was it here?” he murmured through his teeth. “No, there! But the ground has been disturbed.”\nIbarra gave him a look of anguish.\n“Yes,” he went on, “I remember that there was a stone near it. The grave was rather short. The grave-digger was sick, so a farmer had to dig it. But let’s ask that man what has become of the cross.”\nThey went over to where the grave-digger was watching them with curiosity. He removed his salakot respectfully as they approached.\n“Can you tell me which is the grave there that had a cross over it?” asked the servant.\nThe grave-digger looked toward the place and reflected. “A big cross?”\n“Yes, a big one!” affirmed the servant eagerly, with a significant look at Ibarra, whose face lighted up.\n“A carved cross tied up with rattan?” continued the grave-digger.\n“That’s it, that’s it, like this!” exclaimed the servant in answer as he drew on the ground the figure of a Byzantine cross.\n“Were there flowers scattered on the grave?”\n“Oleanders and tuberoses and forget-me-nots, yes!” the servant added joyfully, offering the grave-digger a cigar.\n“Tell us which is the grave and where the cross is.”\nThe grave-digger scratched his ear and answered with a yawn: “Well, as for the cross, I burned it.”\n“Burned it? Why did you burn it?”\n“Because the fat curate ordered me to do so.”\n“Who is the fat curate?” asked Ibarra.\n“Who? Why, the one that beats people with a big cane.”\nIbarra drew his hand across his forehead. “But at least you can tell us where the grave is. You must remember that.”\nThe grave-digger smiled as he answered quietly, “But the corpse is no longer there.”\n“What’s that you’re saying?”\n“Yes,” continued the grave-digger in a half-jesting tone. “I buried a woman in that place a week ago.”\n“Are you crazy?” cried the servant. “It hasn’t been a year since we buried him.”\n“That’s very true, but a good many months ago I dug the body up. The fat curate ordered me to do so and to take it to the cemetery of the Chinamen. But as it was heavy and there was rain that night—”\nHe was stopped by the threatening attitude of Ibarra, who had caught him by the arm and was shaking him. “Did you do that?” demanded the youth in an indescribable tone.\n“Don’t be angry, sir,” stammered the pale and trembling grave-digger. “I didn’t bury him among the Chinamen. Better be drowned than lie among Chinamen, I said to myself, so I threw the body into the lake.”\nIbarra placed both his hands on the grave-digger’s shoulders and stared at him for a long time with an indefinable expression. Then, with the ejaculation, “You are only a miserable slave!” he turned away hurriedly, stepping upon bones, graves, and crosses, like one beside himself.\nThe grave-digger patted his arm and muttered, “All the trouble dead men cause! The fat padre caned me for allowing it to be buried while I was sick, and this fellow almost tore my arm off for having dug it up. That’s what these Spaniards are! I’ll lose my job yet!”\nIbarra walked rapidly with a far-away look in his eyes, while the aged servant followed him weeping. The sun was setting, and over the eastern sky was flung a heavy curtain of clouds. A dry wind shook the tree-tops and made the bamboo clumps creak. Ibarra went bareheaded, but no tear wet his eyes nor did any sigh escape from his breast. He moved as if fleeing from something, perhaps the shade of his father, perhaps the approaching storm. He crossed through the town to the outskirts on the opposite side and turned toward the old house which he had not entered for so many years. Surrounded by a cactus-covered wall it seemed to beckon to him with its open windows, while the ilang-ilang waved its flower-laden branches joyfully and the doves circled about the conical roof of their cote in the middle of the garden.\nBut the youth gave no heed to these signs of welcome back to his old home, his eyes being fixed on the figure of a priest approaching from the opposite direction. It was the curate of San Diego, the pensive Franciscan whom we have seen before, the rival of the alferez. The breeze folded back the brim of his wide hat and blew his guingón habit closely about him, revealing the outlines of his body and his thin, curved thighs. In his right hand he carried an ivory-headed palasan cane.\nThis was the first time that he and Ibarra had met. When they drew near each other Ibarra stopped and gazed at him from head to foot; Fray Salvi avoided the look and tried to appear unconcerned. After a moment of hesitation Ibarra went up to him quickly and dropping a heavy hand on his shoulder, asked in a husky voice, “What did you do with my father?”\nFray Salvi, pale and trembling as he read the deep feelings that flushed the youth’s face, could not answer; he seemed paralyzed.\n“What did you do with my father?” again demanded the youth in a choking voice.\nThe priest, who was gradually being forced to his knees by the heavy hand that pressed upon his shoulder, made a great effort and answered, “You are mistaken, I did nothing to your father.”\n“You didn’t?” went on the youth, forcing him down upon his knees.\n“No, I assure you! It was my predecessor, it was Padre Damaso!”\n“Ah!” exclaimed the youth, releasing his hold, and clapping his hand desperately to his brow; then, leaving poor Fray Salvi, he turned away and hurried toward his house. The old servant came up and helped the friar to his feet.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-xiii-signs-of-storm/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter XIV – Tasio: Lunatic or Sage The peculiar old man wandered about the streets aimlessly. A former student of philosophy, he had given up his career in obedience to his mother’s wishes and not from any lack of means or ability. Quite the contrary, it was because his mother was rich and he was said to possess talent. The good woman feared that her son would become learned and forget God, so she had given him his choice of entering the priesthood or leaving college. Being in love, he chose the latter course and married. Then having lost both his wife and his mother within a year, he sought consolation in his books in order to free himself from sorrow, the cockpit, and the dangers of idleness. He became so addicted to his studies and the purchase of books, that he entirely neglected his fortune and gradually ruined himself. Persons of culture called him Don Anastasio, or Tasio the Sage, while the great crowd of the ignorant knew him as Tasio the Lunatic, on account of his peculiar ideas and his eccentric manner of dealing with others.\nAs we said before, the evening threatened to be stormy. The lightning flashed its pale rays across the leaden sky, the air was heavy and the slight breeze excessively sultry. Tasio had apparently already forgotten his beloved skull, and now he was smiling as he looked at the dark clouds. Near the church he met a man wearing an alpaca coat, who carried in one hand a large bundle of candles and in the other a tasseled cane, the emblem of his office as gobernadorcillo.\n“You seem to be merry?” he greeted Tasio in Tagalog.\n“Truly I am, señor capitan, I’m merry because I hope for something.”\n“Ah? What do you hope for?”\n“The storm!”\n“The storm? Are you thinking of taking a bath?” asked the gobernadorcillo in a jesting way as he stared at the simple attire of the old man.\n“A bath? That’s not a bad idea, especially when one has just stumbled over some trash!” answered Tasio in a similar, though somewhat more offensive tone, staring at the other’s face. “But I hope for something better.”\n“What, then?”\n“Some thunderbolts that will kill people and burn down houses,” returned the Sage seriously.\n“Why don’t you ask for the deluge at once?”\n“We all deserve it, even you and I! You, señor gobernadorcillo, have there a bundle of tapers that came from some Chinese shop, yet this now makes the tenth year that I have been proposing to each new occupant of your office the purchase of lightning-rods. Every one laughs at me, and buys bombs and rockets and pays for the ringing of bells. Even you yourself, on the day after I made my proposition, ordered from the Chinese founders a bell in honor of St. Barbara,1 when science has shown that it is dangerous to ring the bells during a storm. Explain to me why in the year ’70, when lightning struck in Biñan, it hit the very church tower and destroyed the clock and altar. What was the bell of St. Barbara doing then?”\nAt the moment there was a vivid flash. “Jesús, María, y José! Holy St. Barbara!” exclaimed the gobernadorcillo, turning pale and crossing himself.\nTasio burst out into a loud laugh. “You are worthy of your patroness,” he remarked dryly in Spanish as he turned his back and went toward the church.\nInside, the sacristans were preparing a catafalque, bordered with candles placed in wooden sockets. Two large tables had been placed one above the other and covered with black cloth across which ran white stripes, with here and there a skull painted on it.\n“Is that for the souls or for the candles?” inquired the old man, but noticing two boys, one about ten and the other seven, he turned to them without awaiting an answer from the sacristans.\n“Won’t you come with me, boys?” he asked them. “Your mother has prepared a supper for you fit for a curate.”\n“The senior sacristan will not let us leave until eight o’clock, sir,” answered the larger of the two boys. “I expect to get my pay to give it to our mother.”\n“Ah! And where are you going now?”\n“To the belfry, sir, to ring the knell for the souls.”\n“Going to the belfry! Then take care! Don’t go near the bells during the storm!”\nTasio then left the church, not without first bestowing a look of pity on the two boys, who were climbing the stairway into the organ-loft. He passed his hand over his eyes, looked at the sky again, and murmured, “Now I should be sorry if thunderbolts should fall.” With his head bowed in thought he started toward the outskirts of the town.\n“Won’t you come in?” invited a voice in Spanish from a window.\nThe Sage raised his head and saw a man of thirty or thirty-five years of age smiling at him.\n“What are you reading there?” asked Tasio, pointing to a book the man held in his hand.\n“A work just published: ‘The Torments Suffered by the Blessed Souls in Purgatory,’” the other answered with a smile.\n“Man, man, man!” exclaimed the Sage in an altered tone as he entered the house. “The author must be a very clever person.”\n[94]Upon reaching the top of the stairway, he was cordially received by the master of the house, Don Filipo Lino, and his young wife, Doña Teodora Viña. Don Filipo was the teniente-mayor of the town and leader of one of the parties—the liberal faction, if it be possible to speak so, and if there exist parties in the towns of the Philippines.\n“Did you meet in the cemetery the son of the deceased Don Rafael, who has just returned from Europe?”\n“Yes, I saw him as he alighted from his carriage.”\n“They say that he went to look for his father’s grave. It must have been a terrible blow.”\nThe Sage shrugged his shoulders.\n“Doesn’t such a misfortune affect you?” asked the young wife.\n“You know very well that I was one of the six who accompanied the body, and it was I who appealed to the Captain-General when I saw that no one, not even the authorities, said anything about such an outrage, although I always prefer to honor a good man in life rather than to worship him after his death.”\n“Well?”\n“But, madam, I am not a believer in hereditary monarchy. By reason of the Chinese blood which I have received from my mother I believe a little like the Chinese: I honor the father on account of the son and not the son on account of the father. I believe that each one should receive the reward or punishment for his own deeds, not for those of another.”\n“Did you order a mass said for your dead wife, as I advised you yesterday?” asked the young woman, changing the subject of conversation.\n“No,” answered the old man with a smile.\n“What a pity!” she exclaimed with unfeigned regret.\n“They say that until ten o’clock tomorrow the souls will wander at liberty, awaiting the prayers of the living, and that during these days one mass is equivalent to five on [95]other days of the year, or even to six, as the curate said this morning.”\n“What! Does that mean that we have a period without paying, which we should take advantage of?”\n“But, Doray,” interrupted Don Filipo, “you know that Don Anastasio doesn’t believe in purgatory.”\n“I don’t believe in purgatory!” protested the old man, partly rising from his seat. “Even when I know something of its history!”\n“The history of purgatory!” exclaimed the couple, full of surprise. “Come, relate it to us.”\n“You don’t know it and yet you order masses and talk about its torments? Well, as it has begun to rain and threatens to continue, we shall have time to relieve the monotony,” replied Tasio, falling into a thoughtful mood.\nDon Filipo closed the book which he held in his hand and Doray sat down at his side determined not to believe anything that the old man was about to say.\nThe latter began in the following manner: “Purgatory existed long before Our Lord came into the world and must have been located in the center of the earth, according to Padre Astete; or somewhere near Cluny, according to the monk of whom Padre Girard tells us. But the location is of least importance here. Now then, who were scorching in those fires that had been burning from the beginning of the world? Its very ancient existence is proved by Christian philosophy, which teaches that God has created nothing new since he rested.”\n“But it could have existed in potentia and not in actu,”[2] observed Don Filipo.\n“Very well! But yet I must answer that some knew of it and as existing in actu. One of these was Zarathustra, or Zoroaster, who wrote part of the Zend-Avesta and founded a religion which in some points resembles ours, and Zarathustra, according to the scholars, flourished at least eight hundred years before Christ. I say ‘at least,’ since Gaffarel, after examining the testimony of Plato, Xanthus of Lydia, Pliny, Hermippus, and Eudoxus, believes it to have been two thousand five hundred years before our era. However that may be, it is certain that Zarathustra talked of a kind of purgatory and showed ways of getting free from it. The living could redeem the souls of those who died in sin by reciting passages from the Avesta and by doing good works, but under the condition that the person offering the petitions should be a relative, up to the fourth generation. The time for this occurred every year and lasted five days. Later, when this belief had become fixed among the people, the priests of that religion saw in it a chance of profit and so they exploited ‘the deep and dark prison where remorse reigns,’ as Zarathustra called it. They declared that by the payment of a small coin it was possible to save a soul from a year of torture, but as in that religion there were sins punishable by three hundred to a thousand years of suffering, such as lying, faithlessness, failure to keep one’s word, and so on, it resulted that the rascals took in countless sums. Here you will observe something like our purgatory, if you take into account the differences in the religions.”\nA vivid flash of lightning, followed by rolling thunder, caused Doray to start up and exclaim, as she crossed herself: “Jesús, María, y José! I’m going to leave you, I’m going to burn some sacred palm and light candles of penitence.”\nThe rain began to fall in torrents. The Sage Tasio, watching the young woman leave, continued: “Now that she is not here, we can consider this matter more rationally. Doray, even though a little superstitious, is a good Catholic, and I don’t care to root out the faith from her heart. A pure and simple faith is as distinct from fanaticism as the flame from smoke or music from discords: only the fools and the deaf confuse them. Between ourselves we can say that the idea of purgatory is good, holy, and rational. It perpetuates the union of those who were and those who are, leading thus to greater purity of life. The evil is in its abuse.\n“But let us now see where Catholicism got this idea, which does not exist in the Old Testament nor in the Gospels. Neither Moses nor Christ made the slightest mention of it, and the single passage which is cited from Maccabees is insufficient. Besides, this book was declared apocryphal by the Council of Laodicea and the holy Catholic Church accepted it only later. Neither have the pagan religions anything like it. The oft-quoted passage in Virgil, Aliae panduntur inanes,[3] which probably gave occasion for St. Gregory the Great to speak of drowned souls, and to Dante for another narrative in his Divine Comedy, cannot have been the origin of this belief. Neither the Brahmins, the Buddhists, nor the Egyptians, who may have given Rome her Charon and her Avernus, had anything like this idea. I won’t speak now of the religions of northern Europe, for they were religions of warriors, bards, and hunters, and not of philosophers. While they yet preserve their beliefs and even their rites under Christian forms, they were unable to accompany the hordes in the spoliation of Rome or to seat themselves on the Capitoline; the religions of the mists were dissipated by the southern sun. Now then, the early Christians did not believe in a purgatory but died in the blissful confidence of shortly seeing God face to face. Apparently the first fathers of the Church who mentioned it were St. Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and St. Irenaeus, who were all perhaps influenced by Zarathustra’s religion, which still flourished and was widely spread throughout the East, since at every step we read reproaches against Origen’s Orientalism. St. Irenaeus proved its existence by the fact that Christ remained ‘three days in the depths of the earth,’ three days of purgatory, and deduced from this that every soul must remain there until the resurrection of the body, although the ‘Hodie mecum eris in Paradiso’[4] seems to contradict it. St. Augustine also speaks of purgatory and, if not affirming its existence, yet he did not believe it impossible, conjecturing that in another existence there might continue the punishments that we receive in this life for our sins.”\n“The devil with St. Augustine!” ejaculated Don Filipo. “He wasn’t satisfied with what we suffer here but wished a continuance.”\n“Well, so it went” some believed it and others didn’t. Although St. Gregory finally came to admit it in his de quibusdam levibus culpis esse ante judicium purgatorius ignis credendus est,[5] yet nothing definite was done until the year 1439, that is, eight centuries later, when the Council of Florence declared that there must exist a purifying fire for the souls of those who have died in the love of God but without having satisfied divine Justice. Lastly, the Council of Trent under Pius IV in 1563, in the twenty-fifth session, issued the purgatorial decree beginning Cura catholica ecclesia, Spiritu Santo edocta, wherein it deduces that, after the office of the mass, the petitions of the living, their prayers, alms, and other pious works are the surest means of freeing the souls. Nevertheless, the Protestants do not believe in it nor do the Greek Fathers, since they reject any Biblical authority for it and say that our responsibility ends with death, and that the ‘Quodcumque ligaberis in terra,’[6] does not mean ‘usque ad purgatorium,’[7] but to this the answer can be made that since purgatory is located in the center of the earth it fell naturally under the control of St. Peter. But I should never get through if I had to relate all that has been said on the subject. Any day that you wish to discuss the matter with me, come to my house and there we will consult the books and talk freely and quietly.\n“Now I must go. I don’t understand why Christian piety permits robbery on this night—and you, the authorities, allow it—and I fear for my books. If they should steal them to read I wouldn’t object, but I know that there are many who wish to burn them in order to do for me an act of charity, and such charity, worthy of the Caliph Omar, is to be dreaded. Some believe that on account of those books I am already damned—”\n“But I suppose that you do believe in damnation?” asked Doray with a smile, as she appeared carrying in a brazier the dry palm leaves, which gave off a peculiar smoke and an agreeable odor.\n“I don’t know, madam, what God will do with me,” replied the old man thoughtfully. “When I die I will commit myself to Him without fear and He may do with me what He wishes. But a thought strikes me!”\n“What thought is that?”\n“If the only ones who can be saved are the Catholics, and of them only five per cent—as many curates say—and as the Catholics form only a twelfth part of the population of the world—if we believe what statistics show—it would result that after damning millions and millions of men during the countless ages that passed before the Saviour came to the earth, after a Son of God has died for us, it is now possible to save only five in every twelve hundred. That cannot be so! I prefer to believe and say with Job: ‘Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro, and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?’ No, such a calamity is impossible and to believe it is blasphemy!”\n“What do you wish? Divine Justice, divine Purity—”\n“Oh, but divine Justice and divine Purity saw the future before the creation,” answered the old man, as he rose shuddering. “Man is an accidental and not a necessary part of creation, and that God cannot have created him, no indeed, only to make a few happy and condemn hundreds to eternal misery, and all in a moment, for hereditary faults! No! If that be true, strangle your baby son sleeping there! If such a belief were not a blasphemy against that God, who must be the Highest Good, then the Phenician Moloch, which was appeased with human sacrifices and innocent blood, and in whose belly were burned the babes torn from their mothers’ breasts, that bloody deity, that horrible divinity, would be by the side of Him a weak girl, a friend, a mother of humanity!”\nHorrified, the Lunatic—or the Sage—left the house and ran along the street in spite of the rain and the darkness. A lurid flash, followed by frightful thunder and filling the air with deadly currents, lighted the old man as he stretched his hand toward the sky and cried out: “Thou protestest! I know that Thou art not cruel, I know that I must only name Thee Good!”\nThe flashes of lightning became more frequent and the storm increased in violence.\n1 St. Barbara is invoked during thunder-storms as the special protectress against lightning.—TR.\n2 In possibility (i.e., latent) and not: in fact.—TR.\n3\n “For this are various penances enjoined;\nAnd some are hung to bleach upon the wind;\nSome plunged in waters, others purged in fires,\nTill all the dregs are drained, and all the rust expires.”\n Dryden, Virgil’s Aeneid, VI.\n4 “Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.”—Luke xxiii, 43.\n5 It should be believed that for some light faults there is a purgatorial fire before the judgment.\n6 Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth.—Matt, xvi, 19.\n7 Even up to purgatory.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-xiv-tasio-lunatic-or-sage/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter XV – The Sacristans The thunder resounded, roar following close upon roar, each preceded’ by a blinding flash of zigzag lightning, so that it might have been said that God was writing his name in fire and that the eternal arch of heaven was trembling with fear. The rain, whipped about in a different direction each moment by the mournfully whistling wind, fell in torrents. With a voice full of fear the bells sounded their sad supplication, and in the brief pauses between the roars of the unchained elements tolled forth sorrowful peals, like plaintive groans.\nOn the second floor of the church tower were the two boys whom we saw talking to the Sage. The younger, a child of seven years with large black eyes and a timid countenance, was huddling close to his brother, a boy of ten, whom he greatly resembled in features, except that the look on the elder’s face was deeper and firmer.\nBoth were meanly dressed in clothes full of rents and patches. They sat upon a block of wood, each holding the end of a rope which extended upward and was lost amid the shadows above. The wind-driven rain reached them and snuffed the piece of candle burning dimly on the large round stone that was used to furnish the thunder on Good Friday by being rolled around the gallery.\n“Pull on the rope, Crispin, pull!” cried the elder to his little brother, who did as he was told, so that from above was heard a faint peal, instantly drowned out by the reechoing thunder.\n“Oh, if we were only at home now with mother,” sighed the younger, as he gazed at his brother. “There I shouldn’t be afraid.”\nThe elder did not answer; he was watching the melting wax of the candle, apparently lost in thought.\n“There no one would say that I stole,” went on Crispin. “Mother wouldn’t allow it. If she knew that they whip me—”\nThe elder took his gaze from the flame, raised his head, and clutching the thick rope pulled violently on it so that a sonorous peal of the bells was heard.\n“Are we always going to live this way, brother?” continued Crispin. “I’d like to get sick at home tomorrow, I’d like to fall into a long sickness so that mother might take care of me and not let me come back to the convento. So I’d not be called a thief nor would they whip me. And you too, brother, you must get sick with me.”\n“No,” answered the older, “we should all die: mother of grief and we of hunger.”\nCrispin remained silent for a moment, then asked, “How much will you get this month?”\n“Two pesos. They’re fined me twice.”\n“Then pay what they say I’ve stolen, so that they won’t call us thieves. Pay it, brother!”\n“Are you crazy, Crispin? Mother wouldn’t have anything to eat. The senior sacristan says that you’ve stolen two gold pieces, and they’re worth thirty-two pesos.”\nThe little one counted on his fingers up to thirty-two. “Six hands and two fingers over and each finger a peso!” he murmured thoughtfully. “And each peso, how many cuartos?”\n“A hundred and sixty.”\n“A hundred and sixty cuartos? A hundred and sixty times a cuarto? Goodness! And how many are a hundred and sixty?”\n“Thirty-two hands,” answered the older.\nCrispin looked hard at his little hands. “Thirty-two hands,” he repeated, “six hands and two fingers over and each finger thirty-two hands and each finger a cuarto—goodness, what a lot of cuartos! I could hardly count them in three days; and with them could be bought shoes for our feet, a hat for my head when the sun shines hot, a big umbrella for the rain, and food, and clothes for you and mother, and—” He became silent and thoughtful again.\n“Now I’m sorry that I didn’t steal!” he soon exclaimed.\n“Crispin!” reproached his brother.\n“Don’t get angry! The curate has said that he’ll beat me to death if the money doesn’t appear, and if I had stolen it I could make it appear. Anyhow, if I died you and mother would at least have clothes. Oh, if I had only stolen it!”\nThe elder pulled on the rope in silence. After a time he replied with a sigh: “What I’m afraid of is that mother will scold you when she knows about it.”\n“Do you think so?” asked the younger with astonishment. “You will tell her that they’re whipped me and I’ll show the welts on my back and my torn pocket. I had only one cuarto, which was given to me last Easter, but the curate took that away from me yesterday. I never saw a prettier cuarto! No, mother won’t believe it.”\n“If the curate says so—”\nCrispin began to cry, murmuring between his sobs, “Then go home alone! I don’t want to go. Tell mother that I’m sick. I don’t want to go.”\n“Crispin, don’t cry!” pleaded the elder. “Mother won’t believe it—don’t cry! Old Tasio told us that a fine supper is waiting for us.”\n“A fine supper! And I haven’t eaten for a long time. They won’t give me anything to eat until the two gold pieces appear. But, if mother believes it? You must tell her that the senior sacristan is a liar but that the curate believes him and that all of them are liars, that they say that we’re thieves because our father is a vagabond who—”\n[104]At that instant a head appeared at the top of the stairway leading down to the floor below, and that head, like Medusa’s, froze the words on the child’s lips. It was a long, narrow head covered with black hair, with blue glasses concealing the fact that one eye was sightless. The senior sacristan was accustomed to appear thus without noise or warning of any kind. The two brothers turned cold with fear.\n“On you, Basilio, I impose a fine of two reals for not ringing the bells in time,” he said in a voice so hollow that his throat seemed to lack vocal chords. “You, Crispin, must stay tonight, until what you stole reappears.”\nCrispin looked at his brother as if pleading for protection.\n“But we already have permission—mother expects us at eight o’clock,” objected Basilio timidly.\n“Neither shall you go home at eight, you’ll stay until ten.”\n“But, sir, after nine o’clock no one is allowed to be out and our house is far from here.”\n“Are you trying to give me orders?” growled the man irritably, as he caught Crispin by the arm and started to drag him away.\n“Oh, sir, it’s been a week now since we’re seen our mother,” begged Basilio, catching hold of his brother as if to defend him.\nThe senior sacristan struck his hand away and jerked at Crispin, who began to weep as he fell to the floor, crying out to his brother, “Don’t leave me, they’re going to kill me!”\nThe sacristan gave no heed to this and dragged him on to the stairway. As they disappeared among the shadows below Basilio stood speechless, listening to the sounds of his brother’s body striking against the steps. Then followed the sound of a blow and heartrending cries that died away in the distance.\nThe boy stood on tiptoe, hardly breathing and listening fixedly, with his eyes unnaturally wide and his fists clenched. “When shall I be strong enough to plow a field?” he muttered between his teeth as he started below hastily. Upon reaching the organ-loft he paused to listen; the voice of his brother was fast dying away in the distance and the cries of “Mother! Brother!” were at last completely cut off by the sound of a closing door. Trembling and perspiring, he paused for a moment with his fist in his mouth to keep down a cry of anguish. He let his gaze wander about the dimly lighted church where an oil-lamp gave a ghostly light, revealing the catafalque in the center. The doors were closed and fastened, and the windows had iron bars on them. Suddenly he reascended the stairway to the place where the candle was burning and then climbed up into the third floor of the belfry. After untying the ropes from the bell-clappers he again descended. He was pale and his eyes glistened, but not with tears.\nMeanwhile, the rain was gradually ceasing and the sky was clearing. Basilio knotted the ropes together, tied one end to a rail of the balustrade, and without even remembering to put out the light let himself down into the darkness outside. A few moments later voices were heard on one of the streets of the town, two shots resounded, but no one seemed to be alarmed and silence again reigned.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-xv-the-sacristans/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter XVI – Sisa Through the dark night the villagers slept. The families who had remembered their dead gave themselves up to quiet and satisfied sleep, for they had recited their requiems, the novena of the souls, and had burned many wax tapers before the sacred images. The rich and powerful had discharged the duties their positions imposed upon them. On the following day they would hear three masses said by each priest and would give two pesos for another, besides buying a bull of indulgences for the dead. Truly, divine justice is not nearly so exacting as human.\nBut the poor and indigent who earn scarcely enough to keep themselves alive and who also have to pay tribute to the petty officials, clerks, and soldiers, that they may be allowed to live in peace, sleep not so tranquilly as gentle poets who have perhaps not felt the pinches of want would have us believe. The poor are sad and thoughtful, for on that night, if they have not recited many prayers, yet they have prayed much—with pain in their eyes and tears in their hearts. They have not the novenas, nor do they know the responsories, versicles, and prayers which the friars have composed for those who lack original ideas and feelings, nor do they understand them. They pray in the language of their misery: their souls weep for them and for those dead beings whose love was their wealth. Their lips may proffer the salutations, but their minds cry out complaints, charged with lamentations. Wilt Thou be satisfied, O Thou who blessedst poverty, and you, O suffering souls, with the simple prayers of the poor, offered before a rude picture in the light of a dim wick, or do you perhaps desire wax tapers before bleeding Christs and Virgins with small mouths and crystal eyes, and masses in Latin recited mechanically by priests? And thou, Religion preached for suffering humanity, hast thou forgotten thy mission of consoling the oppressed in their misery and of humiliating the powerful in their pride? Hast thou now promises only for the rich, for those who, can pay thee?\nThe poor widow watches among the children who sleep at her side. She is thinking of the indulgences that she ought to buy for the repose of the souls of her parents and of her dead husband. “A peso,” she says, “a peso is a week of happiness for my children, a week of laughter and joy, my savings for a month, a dress for my daughter who is becoming a woman.” “But it is necessary that you put aside these worldly desires,” says the voice that she heard in the pulpit, “it is necessary that you make sacrifices.” Yes, it is necessary. The Church does not gratuitously save the beloved souls for you nor does it distribute indulgences without payment. You must buy them, so tonight instead of sleeping you should work. Think of your daughter, so poorly clothed! Fast, for heaven is dear! Decidedly, it seems that the poor enter not into heaven. Such thoughts wander through the space enclosed between the rough mats spread out on the bamboo floor and the ridge of the roof, from which hangs the hammock wherein the baby swings. The infant’s breathing is easy and peaceful, but from time to time he swallows and smacks his lips; his hungry stomach, which is not satisfied with what his older brothers have given him, dreams of eating.\nThe cicadas chant monotonously, mingling their ceaseless notes with the trills of the cricket hidden in the grass, or the chirp of the little lizard which has come out in search of food, while the big gekko, no longer fearing the water, disturbs the concert with its ill-omened voice as it shows its head from out the hollow of the decayed tree-trunk.\nThe dogs howl mournfully in the streets and superstitious folk, hearing them, are convinced that they see spirits and ghosts. But neither the dogs nor the other animals see the sorrows of men—yet how many of these exist!\nDistant from the town an hour’s walk lives the mother of Basilio and Crispin. The wife of a heartless man, she struggles to live for her sons, while her husband is a vagrant gamester with whom her interviews are rare but always painful. He has gradually stripped her of her few jewels to pay the cost of his vices, and when the suffering Sisa no longer had anything that he might take to satisfy his whims, he had begun to maltreat her. Weak in character, with more heart than intellect, she knew only how to love and to weep. Her husband was a god and her sons were his angels, so he, knowing to what point he was loved and feared, conducted himself like all false gods: daily he became more cruel, more inhuman, more wilful. Once when he had appeared with his countenance gloomier than ever before, Sisa had consulted him about the plan of making a sacristan of Basilio, and he had merely continued to stroke his game-cock, saying neither yes nor no, only asking whether the boy would earn much money. She had not dared to insist, but her needy situation and her desire that the boys should learn to read and write in the town school forced her to carry out the plan. Still her husband had said nothing.\nThat night, between ten and eleven o’clock, when the stars were glittering in a sky now cleared of all signs of the storm of the early evening, Sisa sat on a wooden bench watching some fagots that smouldered upon the fireplace fashioned of rough pieces of natural rock. Upon a tripod, or tunko, was a small pot of boiling rice and upon the red coals lay three little dried fishes such as are sold at three for two cuartos. Her chin rested in the palm of her hand while she gazed at the weak yellow glow peculiar to the cane, which burns rapidly and leaves embers that quickly grow pale. A sad smile lighted up her face as she recalled a funny riddle about the pot and the fire which Crispin had once propounded to her. The boy said: “The black man sat down and the red man looked at him, a moment passed, and cock-a-doodle-doo rang forth.”\nSisa was still young, and it was plain that at one time she had been pretty and attractive. Her eyes, which, like her disposition, she had given to her sons, were beautiful, with long lashes and a deep look. Her nose was regular and her pale lips curved pleasantly. She was what the Tagalogs call kayumanguing-kaligátan; that is, her color was a clear, pure brown. In spite of her youthfulness, pain and perhaps even hunger had begun to make hollow her pallid cheeks, and if her abundant hair, in other times the delight and adornment of her person, was even yet simply and neatly arranged, though without pins or combs, it was not from coquetry but from habit.\nSisa had been for several days confined to the house sewing upon some work which had been ordered for the earliest possible time. In order to earn the money, she had not attended mass that morning, as it would have taken two hours at least to go to the town and return: poverty obliges one to sin! She had finished the work and delivered it but had received only a promise of payment. All that day she had been anticipating the pleasures of the evening, for she knew that her sons were coming and she had intended to make them some presents. She had bought some small fishes, picked the most beautiful tomatoes in her little garden, as she knew that Crispin was very fond of them, and begged from a neighbor, old Tasio the Sage, who lived half a mile away, some slices of dried wild boar’s meat and a leg of wild duck, which Basilio especially liked. Full of hope, she had cooked the whitest of rice, which she herself had gleaned from the threshing-floors. It was indeed a curate’s meal for the poor boys.\nBut by an unfortunate chance her husband came and ate the rice, the slices of wild boar’s meat, the duck leg, five of the little fishes, and the tomatoes. Sisa said nothing, although she felt as if she herself were being eaten. His hunger at length appeased, he remembered to ask for the boys. Then Sisa smiled happily and resolved that she would not eat that night, because what remained was not enough for three. The father had asked for their sons and that for her was better than eating.\nSoon he picked up his game-cock and started away.\n“Don’t you want to see them?” she asked tremulously. “Old Tasio told me that they would be a little late. Crispin now knows how to read and perhaps Basilio will bring his wages.”\nThis last reason caused the husband to pause and waver, but his good angel triumphed. “In that case keep a peso for me,” he said as he went away.\nSisa wept bitterly, but the thought of her sons soon dried her tears. She cooked some more rice and prepared the only three fishes that were left: each would have one and a half. “They’ll have good appetites,” she mused, “the way is long and hungry stomachs have no heart.”\nSo she sat, he ear strained to catch every sound, listening to the lightest footfalls: strong and clear, Basilio; light and irregular, Crispin—thus she mused. The kalao called in the woods several times after the rain had ceased, but still her sons did not come. She put the fishes inside the pot to keep them warm and went to the threshold of the hut to look toward the road. To keep herself company, she began to sing in a low voice, a voice usually so sweet and tender that when her sons listened to her singing the kundíman they wept without knowing why, but tonight it trembled and the notes were halting. She stopped singing and gazed earnestly into the darkness, but no one was coming from the town—that noise was only the wind shaking the raindrops from the wide banana leaves.\nSuddenly a black dog appeared before her dragging something along the path. Sisa was frightened but caught up a stone and threw it at the dog, which ran away howling mournfully. She was not superstitious, but she had heard so much about presentiments and black dogs that terror seized her. She shut the door hastily and sat down by the light. Night favors credulity and the imagination peoples the air with specters. She tried to pray, to call upon the Virgin and upon God to watch over her sons, especially her little Crispin. Then she forgot her prayers as her thoughts wandered to think about them, to recall the features of each, those features that always wore a smile for her both asleep and awake. Suddenly she felt her hair rise on her head and her eyes stared wildly; illusion or reality, she saw Crispin standing by the fireplace, there where he was wont to sit and prattle to her, but now he said nothing as he gazed at her with those large, thoughtful eyes, and smiled.\n“Mother, open the door! Open, mother!” cried the voice of Basilio from without.\nSisa shuddered violently and the vision disappeared.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-xvi-sisa/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter XVII – Basilio  La vida es sueño.\n Basilio was scarcely inside when he staggered and fell into his mother’s arms. An inexplicable chill seized Sisa as she saw him enter alone. She wanted to speak but could make no sound; she wanted to embrace her son but lacked the strength; to weep was impossible. At sight of the blood which covered the boy’s forehead she cried in a tone that seemed to come from a breaking heart, “My sons!”\n“Don’t be afraid, mother,” Basilio reassured her. “Crispin stayed at the convento.”\n“At the convento? He stayed at the convento? Is he alive?”\nThe boy raised his eyes to her. “Ah!” she sighed, passing from the depths of sorrow to the heights of joy. She wept and embraced her son, covering his bloody forehead with kisses.\n“Crispin is alive! You left him at the convento! But why are you wounded, my son? Have you had a fall?” she inquired, as she examined him anxiously.\n“The senior sacristan took Crispin away and told me that I could not leave until ten o’clock, but it was already late and so I ran away. In the town the soldiers challenged me, I started to run, they fired, and a bullet grazed my forehead. I was afraid they would arrest me and beat me and make me scrub out the barracks, as they did with Pablo, who is still sick from it.”\n“My God, my God!” murmured his mother, shuddering. “Thou hast saved him!” Then while she sought for bandages, water, vinegar, and a feather, she went on, “A finger’s breadth more and they would have killed you, they would have killed my boy! The civil-guards do not think of the mothers.”\n“You must say that I fell from a tree so that no one will know they chased me,” Basilio cautioned her.\n“Why did Crispin stay?” asked Sisa, after dressing her son’s wound.\nBasilio hesitated a few moments, then with his arms about her and their tears mingling, he related little by little the story of the gold pieces, without speaking, however, of the tortures they were inflicting upon his young brother.\n“My good Crispin! To accuse my good Crispin! It’s because we’re poor and we poor people have to endure everything!” murmured Sisa, staring through her tears at the light of the lamp, which was now dying out from lack of oil. So they remained silent for a while.\n“Haven’t you had any supper yet? Here are rice and fish.”\n“I don’t want anything, only a little water.”\n“Yes,” answered his mother sadly, “I know that you don’t like dried fish. I had prepared something else, but your father came.”\n“Father came?” asked Basilio, instinctively examining the face and hands of his mother.\nThe son’s questioning gaze pained Sisa’s heart, for she understood it only too well, so she added hastily: “He came and asked a lot about you and wanted to see you, and he was very hungry. He said that if you continued to be so good he would come back to stay with us.”\nAn exclamation of disgust from Basilio’s contracted lips interrupted her. “Son!” she reproached him.\n“Forgive me, mother,” he answered seriously. “But aren’t we three better off—you, Crispin, and I? You’re crying—I haven’t said anything.”\nSisa sighed and asked, “Aren’t you going to eat? Then let’s go to sleep, for it’s now very late.” She then closed up the hut and covered the few coals with ashes so that the fire would not die out entirely, just as a man does with his inner feelings; he covers them with the ashes of his life, which he calls indifference, so that they may not be deadened by daily contact with his fellows.\nBasilio murmured his prayers and lay down near his mother, who was upon her knees praying. He felt hot and cold, he tried to close his eyes as he thought of his little brother who that night had expected to sleep in his mother’s lap and who now was probably trembling with terror and weeping in some dark corner of the convento. His ears were again pierced with those cries he had heard in the church tower. But wearied nature soon began to confuse his ideas and the veil of sleep descended upon his eyes.\nHe saw a bedroom where two dim tapers burned. The curate, with a rattan whip in his hand, was listening gloomily to something that the senior sacristan was telling him in a strange tongue with horrible gestures. Crispin quailed and turned his tearful eyes in every direction as if seeking some one or some hiding-place. The curate turned toward him and called to him irritably, the rattan whistled. The child ran to hide himself behind the sacristan, who caught and held him, thus exposing him to the curate’s fury. The unfortunate boy fought, kicked, screamed, threw himself on the floor and rolled about. He picked himself up, ran, slipped, fell, and parried the blows with his hands, which, wounded, he hid quickly, all the time shrieking with pain. Basilio saw him twist himself, strike the floor with his head, he saw and heard the rattan whistle. In desperation his little brother rose. Mad with pain he threw himself upon his tormentor and bit him on the hand. The curate gave a cry and dropped the rattan—the sacristan caught up a heavy cane and struck the boy a blow on the head so that he fell stunned—the curate, seeing him down, trampled him with his feet. But the child no longer defended himself nor did he cry out; he rolled along the floor, a lifeless mass that left a damp track.[1]\nSisa’s voice brought him back to reality. “What’s the matter? Why are you crying?”\n“I dreamed—O God!” exclaimed Basilio, sitting up, covered with perspiration. “It was a dream! Tell me, mother, that it was only a dream! Only a dream!”\n“What did you dream?”\nThe boy did not answer, but sat drying his tears and wiping away the perspiration. The hut was in total darkness.\n“A dream, a dream!” repeated Basilio in subdued tones.\n“Tell me what you dreamed. I can’t sleep,” said his mother when he lay down again.\n“Well,” he said in a low voice, “I dreamed that we had gone to glean the rice-stalks—in a field where there were many flowers—the women had baskets full of rice-stalks the men too had baskets full of rice-stalks—and the children too—I don’t remember any more, mother, I don’t remember the rest.”\nSisa had no faith in dreams, so she did not insist.\n“Mother, I’ve thought of a plan tonight,” said Basilio after a few moments’ silence.\n“What is your plan?” she asked. Sisa was humble in everything, even with her own sons, trusting their judgment more than her own.\n“I don’t want to be a sacristan any longer.”\n“What?”\n“Listen, mother, to what I’ve been thinking about. Today there arrived from Spain the son of the dead Don Rafael, and he will be a good man like his father. Well now, mother, tomorrow you will get Crispin, collect my wages, and say that I will not be a sacristan any longer. As soon as I get well I’ll go to see Don Crisostomo and ask him to hire me as a herdsman of his cattle and carabaos—I’m now big enough. Crispin can study with old Tasio, who does not whip and who is a good man, even if the curate does not believe so. What have we to fear now from the padre? Can he make us any poorer than we are? You may believe it, mother, the old man is good. I’ve seen him often in the church when no one else was about, kneeling and praying, believe it. So, mother, I’ll stop being a sacristan. I earn but little and that little is taken away from me in fines. Every one complains of the same thing. I’ll be a herdsman and by performing my tasks carefully I’ll make my employer like me. Perhaps he’ll let us milk a cow so that we can drink milk—Crispin likes milk so much. Who can tell! Maybe they’ll give us a little calf if they see that I behave well and we’ll take care of it and fatten it like our hen. I’ll pick fruits in the woods and sell them in the town along with the vegetables from our garden, so we’ll have money. I’ll set snares and traps to catch birds and wild cats,[2] I’ll fish in the river, and when I’m bigger, I’ll hunt. I’ll be able also to cut firewood to sell or to present to the owner of the cows, and so he’ll be satisfied with us. When I’m able to plow, I’ll ask him to let me have a piece of land to plant in sugar-cane or corn and you won’t have to sew until midnight. We’ll have new clothes for every fiesta, we’ll eat meat and big fish, we’ll live free, seeing each other every day and eating together. Old Tasio says that Crispin has a good head and so we’ll send him to Manila to study. I’ll support him by working hard. Isn’t that fine, mother? Perhaps he’ll be a doctor, what do you say?”\n“What can I say but yes?” said Sisa as she embraced her son. She noted, however, that in their future the boy took no account of his father, and shed silent tears.\nBasilio went on talking of his plans with the confidence of the years that see only what they wish for. To everything Sisa said yes—everything appeared good.\nSleep again began to weigh down upon the tired eyelids of the boy, and this time Ole-Luk-Oie, of whom Andersen tells us, spread over him his beautiful umbrella with its pleasing pictures. Now he saw himself with his little brother as they picked guavas, alpay, and other fruits in the woods; they clambered from branch to branch, light as butterflies; they penetrated into the caves and saw the shining rocks; they bathed in the springs where the sand was gold-dust and the stones like the jewels in the Virgin’s crown. The little fishes sang and laughed, the plants bent their branches toward them laden with golden fruit. Then he saw a bell hanging in a tree with a long rope for ringing it; to the rope was tied a cow with a bird’s nest between her horns and Crispin was inside the bell.\nThus he went on dreaming, while his mother, who was not of his age and who had not run for an hour, slept not.\n 1 Dream or reality, we do not know whether this may have happened to any Franciscan, but something similar is related of the Augustinian Padre Piernavieja.—Author’s note.\nFray Antonio Piernavieja, O.S.A., was a parish curate in the province of Bulacan when this work was written. Later, on account of alleged brutality similar to the incident used here, he was transferred to the province of Cavite, where, in 1896, he was taken prisoner by the insurgents and by them made “bishop” of their camp. Having taken advantage of this position to collect and forward to the Spanish authorities in Manila information concerning the insurgents’ preparations and plans, he was tied out in an open field and left to perish of hunger and thirst under the tropical sun.

It’s going to rain fines, and all on account of those two brothers.”\nHe left the sacristy to go up into the rectory, in the hallway of which there awaited him some seven or eight women seated upon benches and a man who was pacing back and forth. Upon seeing him approach, the women arose and one of them pressed forward to kiss his hand, but the holy man made a sign of impatience that stopped her short.\n“Can it be that you’ve lost a real, kuriput?” exclaimed the woman with a jesting laugh, offended at such a reception. “Not to give his hand to me, Matron of the Sisterhood, Sister Rufa!” It was an unheard-of proceeding.\n“He didn’t go into the confessional this morning,” added Sister Sipa, a toothless old woman. “I wanted to confess myself so as to receive communion and get the indulgences.”\n“Well, I’m sorry for you,” commented a young woman with a frank face. “This week I earned three plenary indulgences and dedicated them to the soul of my husband.”\n“Badly done, Sister Juana,” said the offended Rufa. “One plenary indulgence was enough to get him out of purgatory. You ought not to squander the holy indulgences. Do as I do.”\n“I thought, so many more the better,” answered the simple Sister Juana, smiling. “But tell me what you do.”\nSister Rufa did not answer at once. First, she asked for a buyo and chewed at it, gazed at her audience, which was listening attentively, then spat to one side and commenced, chewing at the buyo meanwhile: “I don’t misspend one holy day! Since I’ve belonged to the Sisterhood I’ve earned four hundred and fifty-seven plenary indulgences, seven hundred sixty thousand five hundred and ninety-eight years of indulgence. I set down all that I earn, for I like to have clean accounts. I don’t want to cheat or be cheated.”\nHere Sister Rufa paused to give more attention to her chewing. The women gazed at her in admiration, but the man who was pacing back and forth remarked with some disdain, “Well, this year I’ve gained four plenary indulgences more than you have, Sister Rufa, and a hundred years more, and that without praying much either.”\n“More than I? More than six hundred and eighty-nine plenary indulgences or nine hundred ninety-four thousand eight hundred and fifty-six years?” queried Rufa, somewhat disgruntled.\n“That’s it, eight indulgences and a hundred fifteen years more and a few months over,” answered the man, from whose neck hung soiled scapularies and rosaries.\n“That’s not strange!” admitted Rufa, at last admitting defeat. “You’re an expert, the best in the province.”\nThe flattered man smiled and continued, “It isn’t so wonderful that I earn more than you do. Why, I can almost say that even when sleeping I earn indulgences.”\n“And what do you do with them, sir?” asked four or five voices at the same time.\n“Pish!” answered the man with a gesture of proud disdain. “I have them to throw away!”\n“But in that I can’t commend you, sir,” protested Rufa. “You’ll go to purgatory for wasting the indulgences. You know very well that for every idle word one must suffer forty days in fire, according to the curate; for every span of thread uselessly wasted, sixty days; and for every drop of water spilled, twenty. You’ll go to purgatory.”\n“Well, I’ll know how to get out,” answered Brother Pedro with sublime confidence. “How many souls have I saved from the flames! How many saints have I made! Besides, even in articulo mortis I can still earn, if I wish, at least seven plenary indulgences and shall be able to save others as I die.” So saying, he strode proudly away.\nSister Rufa turned to the others: “Nevertheless, you must do as I do, for I don’t lose a single day and I keep my accounts well. I don’t want to cheat or be cheated.”\n“Well, what do you do?” asked Juana.\n“You must imitate what I do. For example, suppose I earn a year of indulgence: I set it down in my account-book and say, ‘Most Blessed Father and Lord St. Dominic, please see if there is anybody in purgatory who needs exactly a year—neither a day more nor a day less.’ Then I play heads and tails: if it comes heads, no; if tails, yes. Let’s suppose that it comes tails, then I write down paid; if it comes heads, then I keep the indulgence. In this way I arrange groups of a hundred years each, of which I keep a careful account. It’s a pity that we can’t do with them as with money—put them out at interest, for in that way we should be able to save more souls. Believe me, and do as I do.”\n“Well, I do it a better way,” remarked Sister Sipa.\n“What? Better?” demanded the astonished Rufa. “That can’t be! My system can’t be improved upon!”\n“Listen a moment and you’ll be convinced, Sister,” said old Sipa in a tone of vexation.\n“How is it? Let’s hear!” exclaimed the others.\nAfter coughing ceremoniously the old woman began with great care: “You know very well that by saying the Bendita sea tu pureza and the Señor mío Jesucristo, Padre dulcísimo por el gozo, ten years are gained for each letter—”\n“Twenty!” “No, less!” “Five!” interrupted several voices.\n“A few years more or less make no difference. Now, when a servant breaks a plate, a glass, or a cup, I make him pick up the pieces; and for every scrap, even the very smallest, he has to recite for me one of those prayers. The indulgences that I earn in this way I devote to the souls. Every one in my house, except the cats, understands this system.”\n“But those indulgences are earned by the servants and not by you, Sister Sipa,” objected Rufa.\n“And my cups and plates, who pays for them? The servants are glad to pay for them in that way and it suits me also. I never resort to blows, only sometimes a pinch, or a whack on the head.”\n“I’m going to do as you do!” “I’ll do the same!” “And I!” exclaimed the women.\n“But suppose the plate is only broken into two or three pieces, then you earn very few,” observed the obstinate Rufa.\n“Abá!” answered old Sipa. “I make them recite the prayers anyhow. Then I glue the pieces together again and so lose nothing.”\nSister Rufa had no more objections left.\n“Allow me to ask about a doubt of mine,” said young Juana timidly. “You ladies understand so well these matters of heaven, purgatory, and hell, while I confess that I’m ignorant. Often I find in the novenas and other books this direction: three paternosters, three Ave Marias, and three Gloria Patris—”\n“Yes, well?”\n“Now I want to know how they should be recited: whether three paternosters in succession, three Ave Marias in succession, and three Gloria Patris in succession; or a paternoster, an Ave Maria, and a Gloria Patri together, three times?”\n“This way: a paternoster three times—”\n“Pardon me, Sister Sipa,” interrupted Rufa, “they must be recited in the other way. You mustn’t mix up males and females. The paternosters are males, the Ave Marias are females, and the Gloria Patris are the children.”\n“Eh? Excuse me, Sister Rufa: paternoster, Ave Maria, and Gloria are like rice, meat, and sauce—a mouthful for the saints—”\n“You’re wrong! You’ll see, for you who pray that way will never get what you ask for.”\n“And you who pray the other way won’t get anything from your novenas,” replied old Sipa.\n“Who won’t?” asked Rufa, rising. “A short time ago I lost a little pig, I prayed to St. Anthony and found it, and then I sold it for a good price. Abá!”\n“Yes? Then that’s why one of your neighbors was saying that you sold a pig of hers.”\n“Who? The shameless one! Perhaps I’m like you—”\nHere the expert had to interfere to restore peace, for no one was thinking any more about paternosters—the talk was all about pigs. “Come, come, there mustn’t be any quarrel over a pig, Sisters! The Holy Scriptures give us an example to follow. The heretics and Protestants didn’t quarrel with Our Lord for driving into the water a herd of swine that belonged to them, and we that are Christians and besides, Brethren of the Holy Rosary, shall we have hard words on account of a little pig! What would our rivals, the Tertiary Brethren, say?”\nAll became silent before such wisdom, at the same time fearing what the Tertiary Brethren might say. The expert, well satisfied with such acquiescence, changed his tone and continued: “Soon the curate will send for us. We must tell him which preacher we’ve chosen of the three that he suggested yesterday, whether Padre Damaso, Padre Martin, or the coadjutor. I don’t know whether the Tertiary Brethren have yet made any choice, so we must decide.”\n“The coadjutor,” murmured Juana timidly.\n“Ahem! The coadjutor doesn’t know how to preach,” declared Sipa. “Padre Martin is better.”\n“Padre Martin!” exclaimed another disdainfully. “He hasn’t any voice. Padre Damaso would be better.”\n“That’s right!” cried Rufa. “Padre Damaso surely does know how to preach! He looks like a comedian!”\n“But we don’t understand him,” murmured Juana.\n“Because he’s very deep! And as he preaches well—”\nThis speech was interrupted by the arrival of Sisa, who was carrying a basket on her head. She saluted the Sisters and went on up the stairway.\n“She’s going in! Let’s go in too!” they exclaimed. Sisa felt her heart beating violently as she ascended the stairs. She did not know just what to say to the padre to placate his wrath or what reasons she could advance in defense of her son. That morning at the first flush of dawn she had gone into her garden to pick the choicest vegetables, which she placed in a basket among banana-leaves and flowers; then she had looked along the bank of the river for the pakó which she knew the curate liked for salads. Putting on her best clothes and without awakening her son, she had set out for the town with the basket on her head. As she went up the stairway she, tried to make as little noise as possible and listened attentively in the hope that she might hear a fresh, childish voice, so well known to her. But she heard nothing nor did she meet any one as she made her way to the kitchen. There she looked into all the corners. The servants and sacristans received her coldly, scarcely acknowledging her greeting.\n“Where can I put these vegetables?” she asked, not taking any offense at their coldness.\n“There, anywhere!” growled the cook, hardly looking at her as he busied himself in picking the feathers from a capon.\nWith great care Sisa arranged the vegetables and the salad leaves on the table, placing the flowers above them. Smiling, she then addressed one of the servants, who seemed to be more approachable than the cook: “May I speak with the padre?”\n“He’s sick,” was the whispered answer.\n“And Crispin? Do you know if he is in the sacristy?” The servant looked surprised and wrinkled his eyebrows. “Crispin? Isn’t he at your house? Do you mean to deny it?”\n“Basilio is at home, but Crispin stayed here,” answered Sisa, “and I want to see him.”\n“Yes, he stayed, but afterwards he ran away, after stealing a lot of things. Early this morning the curate ordered me to go and report it to the Civil Guard. They must have gone to your house already to hunt for the boys.”\nSisa covered her ears and opened her mouth to speak, but her lips moved without giving out any sound.\n“A pretty pair of sons you have!” exclaimed the cook. “It’s plain that you’re a faithful wife, the sons are so like the father. Take care that the younger doesn’t surpass him.”\nSisa broke out into bitter weeping and let herself fall upon a bench.\n“Don’t cry here!” yelled the cook. “Don’t you know that the padre’s sick? Get out in the street and cry!”\nThe unfortunate mother was almost shoved down the stairway at the very time when the Sisters were coming down, complaining and making conjectures about the curate’s illness, so she hid her face in her pañuelo and suppressed the sounds of her grief. Upon reaching the street she looked about uncertainly for a moment and then, as if having reached a decision, walked rapidly away.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-xviii-souls-in-torment/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Chapter XIX – A Schoolmaster’s Difficulties  El vulgo es necio y pues lo paga, es justo\nHablarle en necio para darle el gusto.[1]\n LOPE DE VEGA\nThe mountain-encircled lake slept peacefully with that hypocrisy of the elements which gave no hint of how its waters had the night before responded to the fury of the storm. As the first reflections of light awoke on its surface the phosphorescent spirits, there were outlined in the distance, almost on the horizon, the gray silhouettes of the little bankas of the fishermen who were taking in their nets and of the larger craft spreading their sails. Two men dressed in deep mourning stood gazing at the water from a little elevation: one was Ibarra and the other a youth of humble aspect and melancholy features.\n“This is the place,” the latter was saying. “From here your father’s body was thrown into the water. Here’s where the grave-digger brought Lieutenant Guevara and me.”\nIbarra warmly grasped the hand of the young man, who went on: “You have no occasion to thank me. I owed many favors to your father, and the only thing that I could do for him was to accompany his body to the grave. I came here without knowing any one, without recommendation, and having neither name nor fortune, just as at present. My predecessor had abandoned the school to engage in the tobacco trade. Your father protected me, secured me a house, and furnished whatever was necessary for running the school. He used to visit the classes and distribute pictures among the poor but studious children, as well as provide them with books and paper. But this, like all good things, lasted only a little while.”\nIbarra took off his hat and seemed to be praying for a time. Then he turned to his companion: “Did you say that my father helped the poor children? And now?”\n“Now they get along as well as possible and write when they can,” answered the youth.\n“What is the reason?”\n“The reason lies in their torn camisas and their downcast eyes.”\n“How many pupils have you now?” asked Ibarra with interest, after a pause.\n“More than two hundred on the roll but only about twenty-five in actual attendance.”\n“How does that happen?”\nThe schoolmaster smiled sadly as he answered, “To tell you the reasons would make a long and tiresome story.”\n“Don’t attribute my question to idle curiosity,” replied Ibarra gravely, while he stared at the distant horizon. “I’ve thought better of it and believe that to carry out my father’s ideas will be more fitting than to weep for him, and far better than to revenge him. Sacred nature has become his grave, and his enemies were the people and a priest. The former I pardon on account of their ignorance and the latter because I wish that Religion, which elevated society, should be respected. I wish to be inspired with the spirit of him who gave me life and therefore desire to know about the obstacles encountered here in educational work.”\n“The country will bless your memory, sir,” said the schoolmaster, “if you carry out the beautiful plans of your dead father! You wish to know the obstacles which the progress of education meets? Well then, under present circumstances, without substantial aid education will never amount to much; in the very first place because, even when we have the pupils, lack of suitable means, and other things that attract them more, kill off their interest. It is said that in Germany a peasant’s son studies for eight years in the town school, but who here would spend half that time when such poor results are to be obtained? They read, write, and memorize selections, and sometimes whole books, in Spanish, without understanding a single word.[2] What benefit does our country child get from the school?”\n“And why have you, who see the evil, not thought of remedying it?”\nThe schoolmaster shook his head sadly. “A poor teacher struggles not only against prejudices but also against certain influences. First, it would be necessary to have a suitable place and not to do as I must at present—hold the classes under the convento by the side of the padre’s carriage. There the children, who like to read aloud, very naturally disturb the padre, and he often comes down, nervous, especially when he has his attacks, yells at them, and even insults me at times. You know that no one can either teach or learn under such circumstances, for the child will not respect his teacher when he sees him abused without standing up for his rights. In order to be heeded and to maintain his authority the teacher needs prestige, reputation, moral strength, and some freedom of action.\n“Now let me recount to you even sadder details. I have wished to introduce reforms and have been laughed at. In order to remedy the evil of which I just spoke to you, I tried to teach Spanish to the children because, in addition to the fact that the government so orders, I thought also that it would be of advantage for everybody. I used the simplest method of words and phrases without paying any attention to long rules, expecting to teach them grammar when they should understand the language. At the end of a few weeks some of the brightest were almost able to understand me and could use a few phrases.”\nThe schoolmaster paused and seemed to hesitate, then, as if making a resolution, he went on: “I must not be ashamed of the story of my wrongs, for any one in my place would have acted the same as I did. As I said, it was a good beginning, but a few days afterwards Padre Damaso, who was the curate then, sent for me by the senior sacristan. Knowing his disposition and fearing to make him wait, I went upstairs at once, saluted him, and wished him good-morning in Spanish. His only greeting had been to put out his hand for me to kiss, but at this he drew it back and without answering me began to laugh loud and mockingly. I was very much embarrassed, as the senior sacristan was present. At the moment I didn’t know just what to say, for the curate continued his laughter and I stood staring at him. Then I began to get impatient and saw that I was about to do something indiscreet, since to be a good Christian and to preserve one’s dignity are not incompatible. I was going to put a question to him when suddenly, passing from ridicule to insult, he said sarcastically, ‘So it’s buenos dins, eh? Buenos dias! How nice that you know how to talk Spanish!’ Then again he broke out into laughter.”\nIbarra was unable to repress a smile.\n“You smile,” continued the schoolmaster, following Ibarra’s example, “but I must confess that at the time I had very little desire to laugh. I was still standing—I felt the blood rush to my head and lightning seemed to flash through my brain. The curate I saw far, far away. I advanced to reply to him without knowing just what I was going to say, but the senior sacristan put himself between us. Padre Damaso arose and said to me in Tagalog: ‘Don’t try to shine in borrowed finery. Be content to talk your own dialect and don’t spoil Spanish, which isn’t meant for you. Do you know the teacher Ciruela?[3] Well, Ciruela was a teacher who didn’t know how to read, and he had a school.’ I wanted to detain him, but he went into his bedroom and slammed the door.\n“What was I to do with only my meager salary, to collect which I have to get the curate’s approval and make a trip to the capital of the province, what could I do against him, the foremost religious and political power in the town, backed up by his Order, feared by the government, rich, powerful, sought after and listened to, always believed and heeded by everybody? Although he insulted me, I had to remain silent, for if I replied he would have had me removed from my position, by which I should lose all hope in my chosen profession. Nor would the cause of education gain anything, but the opposite, for everybody would take the curate’s side, they would curse me and call me presumptuous, proud, vain, a bad Christian, uncultured, and if not those things, then anti-Spanish and a filibuster. Of a schoolmaster neither learning nor zeal is expected; resignation, humility, and inaction only are asked. May God pardon me if I have gone against my conscience and my judgement, but I was born in this country, I have to live, I have a mother, so I have abandoned myself to my fate like a corpse tossed about by the waves.”\n“Did this difficulty discourage you for all time? Have you lived so since?”\n“Would that it had been a warning to me! If only my troubles had been limited to that! It is true that from that time I began to dislike my profession and thought of seeking some other occupation, as my predecessor had done, because any work that is done in disgust and shame is a kind of martyrdom and because every day the school recalled the insult to my mind, causing me hours of great bitterness. But what was I to do? I could not undeceive my mother, I had to say to her that her three years of sacrifice to give me this profession now constituted my happiness. It is necessary to make her believe that this profession is most honorable, the work delightful, the way strewn with flowers, that the performance of my duties brings me only friendship, that the people respect me and show me every consideration. By doing otherwise, without ceasing to be unhappy myself, I should have caused more sorrow, which besides being useless would also be a sin. I stayed on, therefore, and tried not to feel discouraged. I tried to struggle on.”\nHere he paused for a while, then resumed: “From the day on which I was so grossly insulted I began to examine myself and I found that I was in fact very ignorant. I applied myself day and night to the study of Spanish and whatever concerned my profession. The old Sage lent me some books, and I read and pondered over everything that I could get hold of. With the new ideas that I have been acquiring in one place and another my point of view has changed and I have seen many things under a different aspect from what they had appeared to me before. I saw error where before I had seen only truth, and truth in many things where I had formerly seen only error. Corporal punishment, for example, which from time immemorial has been the distinctive feature in the schools and which has heretofore been considered as the only efficacious means of making pupils learn—so we have been accustomed to believe—soon appeared to me to be a great hindrance rather than in any way an aid to the child’s progress. I became convinced that it was impossible to use one’s mind properly when blows, or similar punishment, were in prospect. Fear and terror disturb the most serene, and a child’s imagination, besides being very lively, is also very impressionable. As it is on the brain that ideas are impressed, it is necessary that there be both inner and outer calm, that there be serenity of spirit, physical and moral repose, and willingness, so I thought that before everything else I should cultivate in the children confidence, assurance, and some personal pride. Moreover, I comprehended that the daily sight of floggings destroyed kindness in their hearts and deadened all sense of dignity, which is such a powerful lever in the world. At the same time it caused them to lose their sense of shame, which is a difficult thing to restore. I have also observed that when one pupil is flogged, he gets comfort from the fact that the others are treated in the same way, and that he smiles with satisfaction upon hearing the wails of the others. As for the person who does the flogging, while at first he may do it with repugnance, he soon becomes hardened to it and even takes delight in his gloomy task. The past filled me with horror, so I wanted to save the present by modifying the old system. I endeavored to make study a thing of love and joy, I wished to make the primer not a black book bathed in the tears of childhood but a friend who was going to reveal wonderful secrets, and of the schoolroom not a place of sorrows but a scene of intellectual refreshment. So, little by little, I abolished corporal punishment, taking the instruments of it entirely away from the school and replacing them with emulation and personal pride. If one was careless about his lesson, I charged it to lack of desire and never to lack of capacity. I made them think that they were more capable than they really were, which urged them on to study just as any confidence leads to notable achievements. At first it seemed that the change of method was impracticable; many ceased their studies, but I persisted and observed that little by little their minds were being elevated and that more children came, that they came with more regularity, and that he who was praised in the presence of the others studied with double diligence on the next day.\n“It soon became known throughout the town that I did not whip the children. The curate sent for me, and fearing another scene I greeted him curtly in Tagalog. On this occasion he was very serious with me. He said that I was exposing the children to destruction, that I was wasting time, that I was not fulfilling my duties, that the father who spared the rod was spoiling the child—according to the Holy Ghost—that learning enters with blood, and so on. He quoted to me sayings of barbarous times just as if it were enough that a thing had been said by the ancients to make it indisputable; according to which we ought to believe that there really existed those monsters which in past ages were imaged and sculptured in the palaces and temples. Finally, he charged me to be more careful and to return to the old system, otherwise he would make unfavorable report about me to the alcalde of the province. Nor was this the end of my troubles. A few days afterward some of the parents of the children presented themselves under the convento and I had to call to my aid all my patience and resignation. They began by reminding me of former times when teachers had character and taught as their grandfathers had. ‘Those indeed were the times of the wise men,’ they declared, ‘they whipped, and straightened the bent tree. They were not boys but old men of experience, gray-haired and severe. Don Catalino, king of them all and founder of this very school, used to administer no less than twenty-five blows and as a result his pupils became wise men and priests. Ah, the old people were worth more than we ourselves, yes, sir, more than we ourselves!’ Some did not content themselves with such indirect rudeness, but told me plainly that if I continued my system their children would learn nothing and that they would be obliged to take them from the school It was useless to argue with them, for as a young man they thought me incapable of sound judgment. What would I not have given for some gray hairs! They cited the authority of the curate, of this one and that one, and even called attention to themselves, saying that if it had not been for the whippings they had received from their teachers they would never have learned anything. Only a few persons showed any sympathy to sweeten for me the bitterness of such a disillusioning.\n“In view of all this I had to give up my system, which, after so much toil, was just beginning to produce results. In desperation I carried the whips bank to the school the next day and began the barbarous practice again. Serenity disappeared and sadness reigned in the faces of the children, who had just begun to care for me, and who were my only kindred and friends. Although I tried to spare the whippings and to administer them with all the moderation possible, yet the children felt the change keenly, they became discouraged and wept bitterly. It touched my heart, and even though in my own mind I was vexed with the stupid parents, still I was unable to take any spite out on those innocent victims of their parents’ prejudices. Their tears burned me, my heart seemed bursting from my breast, and that day I left the school before closing-time to go home and weep alone. Perhaps my sensitiveness may seem strange to you, but if you had been in my place you would understand it. Old Don Anastasio said to me, ‘So the parents want floggings? Why not inflict them on themselves?’ As a result of it all I became sick.” Ibarra was listening thoughtfully.\n“Scarcely had I recovered when I returned to the school to find the number of my pupils reduced to a fifth. The better ones had run away upon the return to the old system, and of those who remained—mostly those who came to school to escape work at home—not one showed any joy, not one congratulated me on my recovery. It would have been the same to them whether I got well or not, or they might have preferred that I continue sick since my substitute, although he whipped them more, rarely went to the school. My other pupils, those whose parents had obliged them to attend school, had gone to other places. Their parents blamed me for having spoiled them and heaped reproaches on me for it. One, however, the son of a country woman who visited me during my illness, had not returned on account of having been made a sacristan, and the senior sacristan says that the sacristans must not attend school: they would be dismissed.”\n“Were you resigned in looking after your new pupils?” asked Ibarra.\n“What else could I do?” was the queried reply. “Nevertheless, during my illness many things had happened, among them a change of curates, so I took new hope and made another attempt to the end that the children should not lose all their time and should, in so far as possible, get some benefit from the floggings, that such things might at least have some good result for them. I pondered over the matter, as I wished that even if they could not love me, by getting something useful from me, they might remember me with less bitterness. You know that in nearly all the schools the books are in Spanish, with the exception of the catechism in Tagalog, which varies according to the religious order to which the curate belongs. These books are generally novenas, canticles, and the Catechism of Padre Astete,[4] from which they learn about as much piety as they would from the books of heretics. Seeing the impossibility of teaching the pupils in Spanish or of translating so many books, I tried to substitute short passages from useful works in Tagalog, such as the Treatise on Manners by Hortensio y Feliza, some manuals of Agriculture, and so forth. Sometimes I would myself translate simple works, such as Padre Barranera’s History of the Philippines, which I then dictated to the children, with at times a few observations of my own, so that they might make note-books. As I had no maps for teaching geography, I copied one of the province that I saw at the capital and with this and the tiles of the floor I gave them some idea of the country. This time it was the women who got excited. The men contented themselves with smiling, as they saw in it only one of my vagaries. The new curate sent for me, and while he did not reprimand me, yet he said that I should first take care of religion, that before learning such things the children must pass an examination to show that they had memorized the mysteries, the canticles, and the catechism of Christian Doctrine.\n“So then, I am now working to the end that the children become changed into parrots and know by heart so many things of which they do not understand a single word. Many of them now know the mysteries and the canticles, but I fear that my efforts will come to grief with the Catechism of Padre Astete, since the greater part of the pupils do not distinguish between the questions and the answers, nor do they understand what either may mean. Thus we shall die, thus those unborn will do, while in Europe they will talk of progress.”\n“Let’s not be so pessimistic,” said Ibarra. “The teniente-mayor has sent me an invitation to attend a meeting in the town hall. Who knows but that there you may find an answer to your questions?”\nThe schoolmaster shook his head in doubt as he answered: “You’ll see how the plan of which they talked to me meets the same fate as mine has. But yet, let us see!”\n 1 The common crowd is a fool and since it pays for it, it is proper to talk to it foolishly to please it.\n2 “The schools are under the inspection of the parish priests. Reading and writing in Spanish are taught, or at least it is so ordered; but the schoolmaster himself usually does not know it, and on the other hand the Spanish government employees do not understand the vernacular. Besides, the curates, in order to preserve their influence intact, do not look favorably upon the spread of Castilian. About the only ones who know Spanish are the Indians who have been in the service of Europeans. The first reading exercise is some devotional book, then the catechism; the reader is called Casaysayan. On the average half of the children between seven and ten years attend school; they learn to read fairly well and some to write a little, but they soon forget it.”—Jagor, Viajes por Filipinas (Vidal’s Spanish version). Jagor was speaking particularly of the settled parts of the Bicol region. Referring to the islands generally, his “half of the children” would be a great exaggeration.—TR.\n3 A delicate bit of sarcasm is lost in the translation here. The reference to Maestro Ciruela in Spanish is somewhat similar to a mention in English of Mr. Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall fame.—TR.\n4 By one of the provisions of a royal decree of December 20, 1863, the Catecismo de la Doctrina Cristina, by Gaspar Astete, was prescribed as the text-book for primary schools, in the Philippines.

Its whitewashed walls were covered with drawings in charcoal, more or less ugly and obscene, with inscriptions to complete their meanings. Stacked neatly against the wall in one corner were to be seen about a dozen old flint-locks among rusty swords and talibons, the armament of the cuadrilleros.1 At one end of the hall there hung, half hidden by soiled red curtains, a picture of his Majesty, the King of Spain. Underneath this picture, upon a wooden platform, an old chair spread out its broken arms. In front of the chair was a wooden table spotted with ink stains and whittled and carved with inscriptions and initials like the tables in the German taverns frequented by students. Benches and broken chairs completed the furniture.\nThis is the hall of council, of judgment, and of torture, wherein are now gathered the officials of the town and its dependent villages. The faction of old men does not mix with that of the youths, for they are mutually hostile. They represent respectively the conservative and the liberal parties, save that their disputes assume in the towns an extreme character.\n“The conduct of the gobernadorcillo fills me with distrust,” Don Filipo, the teniente-mayor and leader of the liberal faction, was saying to his friends. “It was a deep-laid scheme, this thing of putting off the discussion of expenses until the eleventh hour. Remember that we have scarcely eleven days left.”\n“And he has staved at the convento to hold a conference with the curate, who is sick,” observed one of the youths.\n“It doesn’t matter,” remarked another. “We have everything prepared. Just so the plan of the old men doesn’t receive a majority—”\n“I don’t believe it will,” interrupted Don Filipo, “as I shall present the plan of the old men myself!”\n“What! What are you saying?” asked his surprised hearers.\n“I said that if I speak first I shall present the plan of our rivals.”\n“But what about our plan?”\n“I shall leave it to you to present ours,” answered Don Filipo with a smile, turning toward a youthful cabeza de barangay.[2] “You will propose it after I have been defeated.”\n“We don’t understand you, sir,” said his hearers, staring at him with doubtful looks.\n“Listen,” continued the liberal leader in a low voice to several near him. “This morning I met old Tasio and the old man said to me: ‘Your rivals hate you more than they do your ideas. Do you wish that a thing shall not be done? Then propose it yourself, and though it were more useful than a miter, it would be rejected. Once they have defeated you, have the least forward person in the whole gathering propose what you want, and your rivals, in order to humiliate you, will accept it.’ But keep quiet about it.”\n“But—”\n“So I will propose the plan of our rivals and exaggerate it to the point of making it ridiculous. Ah, here come Señor Ibarra and the schoolmaster.”\nThese two young men saluted each of the groups without joining either. A few moments later the gobernadorcillo, the very same individual whom we saw yesterday carrying a bundle of candles, entered with a look of disgust on his face. Upon his entrance the murmurs ceased, every one sat down, and silence was gradually established, as he took his seat under the picture of the King, coughed four or five times, rubbed his hand over his face and head, rested his elbows on the table, then withdrew them, coughed once more, and then the whole thing over again.\n“Gentlemen,” he at last began in an unsteady voice, “I have been so bold as to call you together here for this meeting—ahem! Ahem! We have to celebrate the fiesta of our patron saint, San Diego, on the twelfth of this month—ahem!—today is the second—ahem! Ahem!” At this point a slow, dry cough cut off his speech.\nA man of proud bearing, apparently about forty years of age, then arose from the bench of the elders. He was the rich Capitan Basilio, the direct contrast of Don Rafael, Ibarra’s father. He was a man who maintained that after the death of St. Thomas Aquinas the world had made no more progress, and that since St. John Lateran had left it, humanity had been retrograding.\n“Gentlemen, allow me to speak a few words about such an interesting matter,” he began. “I speak first even though there are others here present who have more right to do so than I have, but I speak first because in these matters it seems to me that by speaking first one does not take the first place—no more than that by speaking last does one become the least. Besides, the things that I have to say are of such importance that they should not be put off or last spoken of, and accordingly I wish to speak first in order to give them due weight. So you will allow me to speak first in this meeting where I see so many notable persons, such as the present señor capitan, the former capitan; my distinguished friend, Don Valentin, a former capitan; the friend of my infancy, Don Julio; our celebrated captain of cuadrilleros, Don Melchor; and many other personages, whom, for the sake of brevity, I must omit to enumerate—all of whom you see present here. I beg of you that I may be allowed a few words before any one else speaks. Have I the good fortune to see my humble request granted by the meeting?”\nHere the orator with a faint smile inclined his head respectfully. “Go on, you have our undivided attention!” said the notables alluded to and some others who considered Capitan Basilio a great orator. The elders coughed in a satisfied way and rubbed their hands. After wiping the perspiration from his brow with a silk handkerchief, he then proceeded:\n“Now that you have been so kind and complaisant with my humble self as to grant me the use of a few words before any one else of those here present, I shall take advantage of this permission, so generously granted, and shall talk. In imagination I fancy myself in the midst of the august Roman senate, senatus populusque romanus, as was said in those happy days which, unfortunately for humanity, will nevermore return. I propose to the Patres Conscripti, as the learned Cicero would say if he were in my place, I propose, in view of the short time left, and time is money as Solomon said, that concerning this important matter each one set forth his opinion clearly, briefly, and simply.”\nSatisfied with himself and flattered by the attention in the hall, the orator took his seat, not without first casting a glance of superiority toward Ibarra, who was seated in a corner, and a significant look at his friends as if to say, “Aha! Haven’t I spoken well?” His friends reflected both of these expressions by staring at the youths as though to make them die of envy.\n“Now any one may speak who wishes that—ahem!” began the gobernadorcillo, but a repetition of the cough and sighs cut short the phrase.\nTo judge from the silence, no one wished to consider himself called upon as one of the Conscript Fathers, since no one rose. Then Don Filipo seized the opportunity and rose to speak. The conservatives winked and made significant signs to each other.\n“I rise, gentlemen, to present my estimate of expenses for the fiesta,” he began. “We can’t allow it,” commented a consumptive old man, who was an irreconcilable conservative.\n“We’ll vote against it,” corroborated others. “Gentlemen!” exclaimed Don Filipo, repressing a smile, “I haven’t yet made known the plan which we, the younger men, bring here. We feel sure that this great plan will be preferred by all over any other that our opponents think of or are capable of conceiving.”\nThis presumptuous exordium so thoroughly irritated the minds of the conservatives that they swore in their hearts to offer determined opposition.\n“We have estimated three thousand five hundred pesos for the expenses,” went on Don Filipo. “Now then, with such a sum we shall be able to celebrate a fiesta that will eclipse in magnificence any that has been seen up to this time in our own or neighboring provinces.”\n“Ahem!” coughed some doubters. “The town of A——— has five thousand, B——— has four thousand, ahem! Humbug!”\n“Listen to me, gentlemen, and I’ll convince you,” continued the unterrified speaker. “I propose that we erect a theater in the middle of the plaza, to cost one hundred and fifty pesos.”\n“That won’t be enough! It’ll take one hundred and sixty,” objected a confirmed conservative.\n“Write it down, Señor Director, two hundred pesos for the theater,” said Don Filipo. “I further propose that we contract with a troupe of comedians from Tondo for seven performances on seven successive nights. Seven performances at two hundred pesos a night make fourteen hundred pesos. Write down fourteen hundred pesos, Señor Director!”\nBoth the elders and the youths stared in amazement. Only those in the secret gave no sign.\n“I propose besides that we have magnificent fireworks; no little lights and pin-wheels such as please children and old maids, nothing of the sort. We want big bombs and immense rockets. I propose two hundred big bombs at two pesos each and two hundred rockets at the same price. We’ll have them made by the pyrotechnists of Malabon.”\n“Huh!” grunted an old man, “a two-peso bomb doesn’t frighten or deafen me! They ought to be three-peso ones.”\n“Write down one thousand pesos for two hundred bombs and two hundred rockets.”\nThe conservatives could no longer restrain themselves. Some of them rose and began to whisper together. “Moreover, in order that our visitors may see that we are a liberal people and have plenty of money,” continued the speaker, raising his voice and casting a rapid glance at the whispering group of elders, “I propose: first, four hermanos mayores[3] for the two days of the fiesta; and second, that each day there be thrown into the lake two hundred fried chickens, one hundred stuffed capons, and forty roast pigs, as did Sylla, a contemporary of that Cicero, of whom Capitan Basilio just spoke.”\n“That’s it, like Sylla,” repeated the flattered Capitan Basilio.\nThe surprise steadily increased.\n“Since many rich people will attend and each one will bring thousands of pesos, his best game-cocks, and his playing-cards, I propose that the cockpit run for fifteen days and that license be granted to open all gambling houses—”\nThe youths interrupted him by rising, thinking that he had gone crazy. The elders were arguing heatedly.\n“And, finally, that we may not neglect the pleasures of the soul—”\nThe murmurs and cries which arose all over the hall drowned his voice out completely, and tumult reigned.\n“No!” yelled an irreconcilable conservative. “I don’t want him to flatter himself over having run the whole fiesta, no! Let me speak! Let me speak!”\n“Don Filipo has deceived us,” cried the liberals. “We’ll vote against his plan. He has gone over to the old men. We’ll vote against him!”\nThe gobernadorcillo, more overwhelmed than ever, did nothing to restore order, but rather was waiting for them to restore it themselves.\nThe captain of the cuadrilleros begged to be heard and was granted permission to speak, but he did not open his mouth and sat down again confused and ashamed.\nBy good fortune, Capitan Valentin, the most moderate of all the conservatives, arose and said: “We cannot agree to what the teniente-mayor has proposed, as it appears to be exaggerated. So many bombs and so many nights of theatrical performances can only be desired by a young man, such as he is, who can spend night after night sitting up and listening to so many explosions without becoming deaf. I have consulted the opinion of the sensible persons here and all of them unanimously disapprove Don Filipo’s plan. Is it not so, gentlemen?”\n“Yes, yes!” cried the youths and elders with one voice. The youths were delighted to hear an old man speak so.\n“What are we going to do with four hermanos mayores?” went on the old man. “What is the meaning of those chickens, capons, and roast pigs, thrown into the lake? ‘Humbug!’ our neighbors would say. And afterwards we should have to fast for six months! What have we to do with Sylla and the Romans? Have they ever invited us to any of their festivities, I wonder? I, at least, have never received any invitation from them, and you can all see that I’m an old man!”\n“The Romans live in Rome, where the Pope is,” Capitan Basilio prompted him in a low voice. “Now I understand!” exclaimed the old man calmly.\n“They would make of their festivals watch-meetings, and the Pope would order them to throw their food into the sea so that they might commit no sin. But, in spite of all that, your plan is inadmissible, impossible, a piece of foolishness!”\nBeing so stoutly opposed, Don Filipo had to withdraw his proposal. Now that their chief rival had been defeated, even the worst of the irreconcilable insurgents looked on with calmness while a young cabeza de barangay asked for the floor.\n“I beg that you excuse the boldness of one so young as I am in daring to speak before so many persons respected for their age and prudence and judgment in affairs, but since the eloquent orator, Capitan Basilio, has requested every one to express his opinion, let the authoritative words spoken by him excuse my insignificance.”\nThe conservatives nodded their heads with satisfaction, remarking to one another: “This young man talks sensibly.” “He’s modest.” “He reasons admirably.”\n“What a pity that he doesn’t know very well how to gesticulate,” observed Capitan Basilio. “But there’s time yet! He hasn’t studied Cicero and he’s still a young man!”\n“If I present to you, gentlemen, any program or plan,” the young man continued, “I don’t do so with the thought that you will find it perfect or that you will accept it, but at the same time that I once more bow to the judgment of all of you, I wish to prove to our elders that our thoughts are always like theirs, since we take as our own those ideas so eloquently expressed by Capitan Basilio.”\n“Well spoken! Well spoken!” cried the flattered conservatives. Capitan Basilio made signs to the speaker showing him how he should stand and how he ought to move his arm. The only one remaining impassive was the gobernadorcillo, who was either bewildered or preoccupied; as a matter of fact, he seemed to be both. The young man went on with more warmth:\n“My plan, gentlemen, reduces itself to this: invent new shows that are not common and ordinary, such as we see every day, and endeavor that the money collected may not leave the town, and that it be not wasted in smoke, but that it be used in some manner beneficial to all.”\n“That’s right!” assented the youths. “That’s what we want.”\n“Excellent!” added the elders.\n“What should we get from a week of comedies, as the teniente-mayor proposes? What can we learn from the kings of Bohemia and Granada, who commanded that their daughters’ heads be cut off, or that they should be blown from a cannon, which later is converted into a throne? We are not kings, neither are we barbarians; we have no cannon, and if we should imitate those people, they would hang us on Bagumbayan. What are those princesses who mingle in the battles, scattering thrusts and blows about in combat with princes, or who wander alone over mountains and through valleys as though seduced by the tikbálang? Our nature is to love sweetness and tenderness in woman, and we would shudder at the thought of taking the blood-stained hand of a maiden, even when the blood was that of a Moro or a giant, so abhorred by us. We consider vile the man who raises his hand against a woman, be he prince or alferez or rude countryman. Would it not be a thousand times better to give a representation of our own customs in order to correct our defects and vices and to encourage our better qualities?”\n“That’s right! That’s right!” exclaimed some of his faction.\n“He’s right,” muttered several old men thoughtfully.\n“I should never have thought of that,” murmured Capitan Basilio.\n“But how are you going to do it?” asked the irreconcilable.\n“Very easily,” answered the youth. “I have brought here two dramas which I feel sure the good taste and recognized judgment of the respected elders here assembled will find very agreeable and entertaining. One is entitled ‘The Election of the Gobernadorcillo,’ being a comedy in prose in five acts, written by one who is here present. The other is in nine acts for two nights and is a fantastical drama of a satirical nature, entitled ‘Mariang Makiling,’4 written by one of the best poets of the province. Seeing that the discussion of preparations for the fiesta has been postponed and fearing that there would not be time enough left, we have secretly secured the actors and had them learn their parts. We hope that with a week of rehearsal they will have plenty of time to know their parts thoroughly. This, gentlemen, besides being new, useful, and reasonable, has the great advantage of being economical; we shall not need costumes, as those of our daily life will be suitable.”\n“I’ll pay for the theater!” shouted Capitan Basilio enthusiastically.\n“If you need cuadrilleros, I’ll lend you mine,” cried their captain.\n“And I—and I—if art old man is needed—” stammered another one, swelling with pride.\n“Accepted! Accepted!” cried many voices.\nDon Filipo became pale with emotion and his eyes filled with tears.\n“He’s crying from spite,” thought the irreconcilable, so he yelled, “Accepted! Accepted without discussion!” Thus satisfied with revenge and the complete defeat of his rival, this fellow began to praise the young man’s plan.\nThe latter continued his speech: “A fifth of the money collected may be used to distribute a few prizes, such as to the best school child, the best herdsman, farmer, fisherman, and so on. We can arrange for boat races on the river and lake and for horse races on shore, we can raise greased poles and also have other games in which our country people can take part. I concede that on account of our long-established customs we must have some fireworks; wheels and fire castles are very beautiful and entertaining, but I don’t believe it necessary to have bombs, as the former speaker proposed. Two bands of music will afford sufficient merriment and thus we shall avoid those rivalries and quarrels between the poor musicians who come to gladden our fiesta with their work and who so often behave like fighting-cocks, afterwards going away poorly paid, underfed, and even bruised and wounded at times. With the money left over we can begin the erection of a small building for a schoolhouse, since we can’t wait until God Himself comes down and builds one for us, and it is a sad state of affairs that while we have a fine cockpit our children study almost in the curate’s stable. Such are the outlines of my plan; the details can be worked out by all.”\nA murmur of pleasure ran through the hall, as nearly every one agreed with the youth.\nSome few muttered, “Innovations! Innovations! When we were young—”\n“Let’s adopt it for the time being and humiliate that fellow,” said others, indicating Don Filipo.\nWhen silence was restored all were agreed. There was lacking only the approval of the gobernadorcillo. That worthy official was perspiring and fidgeting about. He rubbed his hand over his forehead and was at length able to stammer out in a weak voice: “I also agree, but—ahem!”\nEvery one in the hall listened in silence.\n“But what?” asked Capitan Basilio.\n“Very agreeable,” repeated the gobernadorcillo, “that is to say—I don’t agree—I mean—yes, but—” Here he rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand. “But the curate,” the poor fellow went on, “the curate wants something else.”\n“Does the curate or do we ourselves pay for this fiesta? Has he given a cuarto for it?” exclaimed a penetrating voice. All looked toward the place whence these questions came and saw there the Sage Tasio.\nDon Filipo remained motionless with his eyes fixed on the gobernadorcillo.\n“What does the curate want?” asked Capitan Basilio.\n“Well, the padre wants six processions, three sermons, three high masses, and if there is any money left, a comedy from Tondo with songs in the intermissions.”\n“But we don’t want that,” said the youths and some of the old men.\n“The curate wants it,” repeated the gobernadorcillo. “I’ve promised him that his wish shall be carried out.”\n“Then why did you have us assemble here?”\n“F-for the very purpose of telling you this!”\n“Why didn’t you tell us so at the start?”\n“I wanted to tell you, gentlemen, but Capitan Basilio spoke and I haven’t had a chance. The curate must be obeyed.”\n“He must be obeyed,” echoed several old men.\n“He must be obeyed or else the alcalde will put us all in jail,” added several other old men sadly.\n“Well then, obey him, and run the fiesta yourselves,” exclaimed the youths, rising. “We withdraw our contributions.”\n“Everything has already been collected,” said the gobernadorcillo.\nDon Filipo approached this official and said to him bitterly, “I sacrificed my pride in favor of a good cause; you are sacrificing your dignity as a man in favor of a bad one, and you’ve spoiled everything.”\nIbarra turned to the schoolmaster and asked him, “Is there anything that I can do for you at the capital of the province? I leave for there immediately.”\n“Have you some business there?”\n“We have business there!” answered Ibarra mysteriously.\nOn the way home, when Don Filipo was cursing his bad luck, old Tasio said to him: “The blame is ours! You didn’t protest when they gave you a slave for a chief, and I, fool that I am, had forgotten it!”\n 1 The municipal police of the old régime. They were thus described by a Spanish writer, W. E. Retana, in a note to Ventura F. Lopez’s El Filibustero (Madrid, 1893): “Municipal guards, whose duties are principally rural. Their uniform is a disaster; they go barefoot; on horseback, they hold the reins in the right hand and a lance in the left. They are usually good-for-nothing, but to their credit it must be said that they do no damage. Lacking military instruction, provided with fire-arms of the first part of the century, of which one in a hundred might go off in case of need, and for other arms bolos, talibons, old swords, etc., the cuadrilleros are truly a parody on armed force.”—TR.\n2 Headman and tax-collector of a district, generally including about fifty families, for whose annual tribute he was personally responsible. The “barangay” is a Malay boat of the kind supposed to have been used by the first emigrants to the Philippines. Hence, at first, the “head of a barangay” meant the leader or chief of a family or group of families. This office, quite analogous to the old Germanic or Anglo-Saxon “head of a hundred,” was adopted and perpetuated by the Spaniards in their system of local administration.—TR.\n3 The hermano mayor was a person appointed to direct the ceremonies during the fiesta, an appointment carrying with it great honor and importance, but also entailing considerable expense, as the appointee was supposed to furnish a large share of the entertainments. Hence, the greater the number of hermanos mayores the more splendid the fiesta,—TR.\n4 Mt. Makiling is a volcanic cone at the southern end of the Lake of Bay. At its base is situated the town of Kalamba, the author’s birthplace. About this mountain cluster a number of native legends having as their principal character a celebrated sorceress or enchantress, known as “Mariang Makiling.”—TR.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/chapter-xx-the-meeting-in-the-town-hall/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"→ [Zairyu Shikaku Nintei Shomeisho](/japan-guide/keywords/yz09/zairyu-shikaku-nintei-shomeisho-certificate-of-eligibility)\n","excerpt":"→ [Zairyu Shikaku Nintei …","ref":"/guide/keywords/abcd/certificate-of-eligibility-coe/","tags":"","title":"Certificate of Eligibility (COE) "},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"→ [Zaishoku Shomeisho](/japan-guide/keywords/yz09/zaishoku-shomeisho-employment-certificate)\n","excerpt":"→ [Zaishoku …","ref":"/guide/keywords/abcd/certificate-of-employment/","tags":"","title":"Certificate of Employment"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"→ [Zaishoku Shomeisho](/japan-guide/keywords/yz09/zaishoku-shomeisho-employment-certificate)\n","excerpt":"→ [Zaishoku …","ref":"/guide/keywords/efgh/employment-certificate/","tags":"","title":"Employment Certificate"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"→ [Koyo Hoken](/japan-guide/keywords/ijkl/koyo-hoken-employment-insurance)\n","excerpt":"→ [Koyo …","ref":"/guide/keywords/efgh/employment-insurance/","tags":"","title":"Employment Insurance"},{"body":"Literal na ibig sabihin: “Source collection slip”.

However, the thing that should be magnified in this august title is how the scope of influence is boundless. F. Sionil José is widely acknowledged as part of the Philippines’ National Artist in Literature, bestowed by his works that reflect nationalism, anti-elite notions and social underpinnings of colonialism and class struggles which are still relevant at this time.\nIt is now an open secret how this administration imposed record-high numbers of killings and acts of oppression to the critics and progressives. In the recent tally of the National Union of Journalists in the Philippines (NUJP), the country has recorded 19 murders, 37 libel cases, 52 intimidation cases, 20 online harassment cases since the Duterte administration began to reign. In line with this horrific scenario, the apparency of both suppression and oppression is more than obvious. Being a figure of expression, F Sionil Jose made statements that revealed how he must be a genius of FICTION. The operative words to begin, fiction.\nIn a column for the Philippine Star titled, Independence, José claimed with aplomb that Duterte is the next gold of the country–analogizing to the former president, Ramon Magsaysay. Without reluctance, he was able to hastily justify the president’s foul language and his distorted idea of “best” ruling. This belies the dreadful state of activism and progression, which the Commission on Human Rights described as the “worst state” of press freedom after the country downgraded from 136th to 138th rank in 2021 World Press Freedom Index.\nAmidst the controversial shutting down of ABS-CBN where censures went through the roofs, it was shocking how José’s justified this sudden termination of the country’s largest media network. He wrote a “requiem” stating that he sympathized with the number of Filipino families who lost their jobs but he assured that he will never mourn with ABS-CBN shutdown. Unhesitatingly, he ended his requiem by stating that “The Filipinos do not really need ABS-CBN”. His profound approval to the discontinuity of the network was catalyzed by his personal hate towards the oligarchs of the people. Alongside shutting down a media outfit, it ramified 11,000 workers to lose their jobs, but a body of expression which ought to defend the freedom of expression, had weaponized his power to cheer up in this horror.\nIf one thing is more dreadful than the rest, is how José phlegmatically stated that the country during Duterte’s governance is “far safer now”. The unforgettable bloodshed of the extra-judicial killings caused by Duterte’s war-on-drugs, the high-rise number of killings of media practitioners, peasant activists and progressives- these are just the few of the many contradictions on how it is possible for a public figure to call out country “safe”. The fear cuts deeper and deeper as the 2020 Social Weather Station reveals that 65 percent of Filipino adults believe that it is fearful to publish any print or broadcast critical takes against the administration even if it’s the truth.\nJohn Pablo Salud, a fellow book author vented out his disappointment on how José’s consistent reliance on the government is still unwavered despite the current reports of media killings and progressives repression. To be fair, it was also stated by Salud that José’s factors of aging and mental capacities are weakening due to suffering from dementia. These details were put into consideration why José is still an avid believer of this administration. However, Salud stated that “when people are being murdered, siding with the executioners is not a matter of debate”. Foremost, it is beyond “catastrophic” to realize how an influential body of Arts, which seemed to be an undying discipline especially today, is still choosing to shut their unquestionable ability to call out and influence.\nArt is the ultimate form of expression. It is saddening to know that a representation of Filipino art is enabling a fascist to retrograde the country’s freedom of speech and entitlement of opinions. José being earmarked as a genius of fiction must have been the best label. Everything he consistently believes in seems so unreal to take. However, the lives taken and identities harassed were not products of just mere imagination and no flowering words nor understatement can sugarcoat this trepidation- this is the real state of the country.\nLocalizing more the significance of why this needs to be called out,just imagine the number of educators who look up to these national figures as inspirations to teach the youth. Domino effect it must be, being one of the pioneers of arts is more than the title itself but the accountability it holds. It is very undeniable how educators can be also a subject of enabling fascism. It is very undoubtful how this influence of supporting a fascist translates over huge personalities just like Harry Roque, a former law professor. A pill that is hard to swallow, not everyone who educates, is truly educated.\nStarting from a normal scenario, when educators refuse to hear the appeals and opinions of their students up to the fact that many professors are still in their stand to support this government. A learning setting should guarantee a learner’s feeling of safety, but up to this day professors who neglect political opposition and critics do not guarantee a secured learning environment. It was stated by José the notable quote that “the influence of teachers extends beyond the classroom well into the future”. He spoke for himself and his massive influence together with the power of an educator to impact a learner- now it boils down to what kind of influence that is translated with their stands.\nIt seems confusing, what is more unsettling, is the fact that a National Artist enables a fascist which serves an utter irony to how he views himself as an anti-dictator and his works defying anti-elite views or how his scope of influence can even transcends through educators and professors that are disposed in nurturing the youth? Truth to tell, degree and prestige is sometimes weaponized to stay in privilege and the fact that they are benefiting in this fascist system. No one questions the ability of F. Sionil José as a prolific writer, his to write in excellence nor the capability of educators to teach.

Isang taon mahigit ang lumipas nang kumalat ang COVID-19 sa Pilipinas, ngunit ang mga pangyayari ay bumabalik pa rin sa simula, tulad ng proseso ng rebolusyong pabalik-balik at hindi matapos-tapos.\nDahil sa pagsasawalang-bahala sa pagsipat sa tunay na problema at kakulangan ng konkretong plano ng rehimeng Duterte sa pagsugpo sa krisis pangkalusugan buhat ng COVID-19, muli’t muli lamang napipilayan ang kabuhayan ng masang Pilipino.\nMula nang sumipa ang kaso ng COVID-19 sa bansa, dalawa sa sampu o 17.7% ng mga Pilipino ang unemployed. Ayon sa Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), ito ang pinakamataas na unemployment rate sa loob ng nagdaang 16 na taon.\nNitong nakaraan lamang, nagbigay ang DSWD ng P4,000 na ayuda kada pamilya para sa mga nasa Greater Manila Area na isinailalim muli sa ECQ. Sa kabila nito, marami ang dumaing na hindi sapat ang ayuda sa mamamayan buhat ng kapabayaan at kapalpakan ng restriksyon sa pagbubukas ng ekonomiya sa kabila ng sinusunod na quarantine protocols. Nababagabag ang mamamayan sa patuloy na pagtaas ng presyo ng mga bilihin at bayarin habang mababang pasahod hanggang sa kawalan ng kabuhayan kaya’t lugmok sa kagutuman ang mga Pilipino.\nBase sa pagsusuri ng PSA, nito lamang Pebrero umabot na sa 4.6% ang inflation rate sa presyo ng mga bilihin sa bansa. Ngayong tag-init, kasabay ng pagtaas ng konsumo sa tubig at kuryente ay tiyak din na malaki ang bayarin dito.\nHindi maikakaila na mayroong mga nananawagan na taasan ang halaga ng ayudang ipinamamahagi kada pamilya sabay rin ang pagsasabatas ng “livable wage” sa bansa.\nSa kabila nito, isinaad ni Pangulong Duterte noong nakaraang taon na wala nang pera ang bansa at wala na itong kakayahang mamahagi ng pagkain at pera sa mga mamamayan.\nMarso ngayong taon, pormal nang itinaas ng Makabayan Bloc ang House Bill 9089 na P10,000 ayuda sa Kongreso. Nakalahad sa naturang batas na nararapat na makatanggap ng P10,000 ayuda ang mga Pilipino sa loob ng dalawang magkasunod na buwan.\nNgunit kalabisan nga bang maituturing ang P10,000 ayuda?\nSa mata ng masang manggagawa Para kay Ericka Jane Valderamos, isang Iskolar ng Bayan at work-from-home call center agent sa isang BPO company sa Cainta, Rizal, malaki ang maitutulong ng P10,000 ayuda bilang pantustos sa arawang gastusin.\nItinuturing na breadwinner si Valderamos ng kanilang pamilya sapagkat siya ang panganay sa anim na magkakapatid.\nNaisipan niyang magtrabaho habang nag-aaral upang makatulong sa lumalaking gastusin kasabay pa ng pagtaas ng presyo ng mga pangunahing bilihin.\nResulta ng kasalukuyang pandemya ang paghina at kawalang kita ng maliit na canteen ng kanyang ama sa palengke malapit sa kanilang tirahan sa siyudad ng Pasig.\nDagdag niya, walang dine-in sa kanila bagkus puro take-out na lamang batay sa umiiral na guideline ng modified enhanced community quarantine sa NCR+ bubble.\nSamantala, nagbigay siya ng sentimyento tungkol sa hindi makatwirang Manila bay dolomite sand project ng Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) at Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) na gumastos ng milyong halaga aniya, “Kasi nga ang daming naghihirap ngayon, sobrang incompetent nila [gobyerno] mas iniisip pa nila (ang) ibang bagay kaysa riyan… dapat yung perang pang dolomite ginawang ayuda. “\nIginiit ni Valderamos, higit na makatutulong ang P10,000 ayuda pandagdag sa kanilang badyet ngunit maisakatuparan lamang daw ang hinahangad na ayuda sa bawat pamilya kung pokus lamang ang gobyerno sa higit na kailangan ng masa.\nIto rin ang naging sentimyento ng solo parent na si Maria*, sapagkat ilang buwan itong nawalan ng trabaho buhat ng pansamantalang tigil-operasyon sa pinagtatrabahuang fast food restaurant noong kasagsagan ng ECQ noong nakaraang taon.\n“Hindi sumasapat ang naitabi ko para sa gastusin ng anak ko. Umasa rin ako sa ayuda ng gobyerno, nakatulong pero hindi sapat [ang halaga ng ibinigay na ayuda],” saad nito.\nPara kay Maria*, malaking tulong kung maisasakatuparan ang pamamahagi ng P10,000 ayuda upang maitawid ang gutom sa loob ng ilang araw at makapag-abot ng panggastos sa kanilang tahanan. Sa kabila nito, sinabi niya na kulang ang pagbibigay ng ayuda kung hindi masosolusyunan ang malawakang pagkawala ng trabaho.\n“Mensahe ko sa gobyerno na ilaan nang maayos ang pondo lalo na sa mga nawalan ng trabaho na siyang tanging bumubuhay sa kanyang pamilya. Nawa’y naabutan lahat ng sapat na ayuda dahil tax namin iyon at pagdating ng panahon lahat ng Pilipino ang siyang magbabayad ng utang ng gobyerno,” ang panawagan ni Maria* sa mga kinauukulan.\nNito lamang Abril, inilunsad ng grupo ng masang Pilipino ang adbokasiyang 10k Ayuda Na Network.\n“Ang 10K Ayuda Na Network ay isang malawak na samahan ng maralitang Pilipino para kagyat na mailabas at makamit ang maayos na distribusyon ng P10,000 ayuda. Layon ng network na tuloy-tuloy na mangalampag, makipag-diyalogo, at itulak ang pamahalaan na tuparin ang kanyang responsibilidad sa naghihikahos na mamamayan,” saad ng organisasyon sa kanilang Facebook Page.\nSampung libong ayuda, saan naman kukunin? Batay sa National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) noong 2018, sapat ang P10,000 para sa average na pamilyang binubuo ng limang miyembro.\nBilang suporta rito, ayon sa pagsusuri ng non-government research center na IBON Foundation nitong Pebrero, mayroon pang nalalabing P178.5 bilyong halaga mula sa Bayanihan 1 at 2, taliwas sa sinasabi ni Duterte na wala nang pera ang bansa. Ayon sa NGO, ang kinakailangan lamang ay bigyan prayoridad ng gobyerno ang pamamahagi ng ayuda.\nDagdag pa, ayon sa kasalukuyang datos ng Bureau of the Treasury, umabot na sa Php 10.7 trilyon ang halaga ng inutang ng Pilipinas upang mabigyang tugon ang pagkalat ng COVID-19 at tulungan ang mga Pilipinong labis na naapektuhan dahil sa mga nagsarang kumpanya at mga establisyemento.\nTaliwas dito, sa pananaliksik na isinagawa ng IBON Foundation nitong Pebrero, ang pagpapatupad ng ECQ at MECQ sa mga lugar sa ilalim ng NCR+ ay nakapagdagdag lamang ng 12.1 milyon sa unemployed at underemployed na Pilipino sa bansa.\nItinuturong dahilan ng higit na pagtaas ng unemployment at underemployment rate ay ang kapabayaan ng gobyerno sa pagbibigay ng agarang solusyon at aksyon laban sa COVID-19.\nSa kabila ng pangungutang upang tulungan umano para sa mga Pilipinong labis na naapektuhan ng pandemya, inilahad sa breakdown ng inaprubahang badyet ngayong taon ang napakalaking agwat ng alokasyon sa DOH na mayroon lamang Php 210.2 bilyon kumpara sa DPWH na mayroong Php 695.7 bilyon at Php 249.4 bilyon sa DILG.\nPara sa IBON Foundation, ang kakagyatan sa pagresponde sa pandemya, pagtulong sa mga maysakit at ang pag-agapay sa mga Pilipinong nawalan ng hanapbuhay ang dapat pagtuunan ng pansin ng gobyerno, hindi ang pagpapatupad ng mga batas na aakit lamang sa mga dayuhang mamumuhunan sa bansa.\nIlan sa mga batas na agarang inamyendahan ni Pangulong Duterte sa kalagitnaan ng pandemya ay ang Public Services Act o ang pabibigay pahintulot sa full participation ng mga dayuhan sa pampublikong transportasyon at komunikasyon sa bansa; Foreign Investments Act, na naglalayong pababain ang required na bilang ng empleyadong Pilipino sa dayuhang korporasyon; at Retail Trade Liberalization Act, na isinusulong ang pagpapababa sa paid-up capital ng mga dayong negosyante.\nSa kabilang banda, batay sa datos ng Asian Development Bank (ADB), buhat ng mababang fiscal stimulus at mataas na kaso ng COVID-19 sa bansa, umabot lamang sa 3.8% ang Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ng Pilipinas. Ito ang pinakamababa sa buong Southeast Asia.\nKaugnay nito, isinaad ng PUP Economics Research Society Vice President for Finance na si Jennifer Balgos ang adbentahe ng pamamahagi ng P10,000 ayuda.\n“Patungkol naman sa mabuting dulot ng P10,000 na ayuda, maituturing itong isa sa economic stimulus ng gobyerno na maaaring ituring na parte ng ating kasalukuyang fiscal policy na kung saan ay higit na makapag-aambag sa paglago ng ating GDP,” pagpapaliwanag ni Balgos.\nKaya, inirerekomenda ng IBON Foundation ang pagkakaroon ng expansionary fiscal policy o ang pagggastos ng gobyerno sa mga proyekto upang muling pasiglahin ang ekonomiya ng bansa. Iminumungkahi ng organisasyon ang badyet na nagkakahalagang Php 1.5 trilyon para rito.\nInilatag ng IBON ang mga maaaring pagkunan ng ganoong halaga gaya na lamang ng pag-realign sa pambansang badyet, pagpapataas ng buwis sa mga dambuhalang negosyante, pag-iisyu ng emergency bonds, pagbebenta ng government securities, at pagpapatupad ng land value tax.\nNakapaloob dito ang Php 540 bilyon na ayuda para sa 18 milyon na poor-low income families (tig-P10,000 kada pamilya sa loob ng tatlong buwan); Php 101 bilyon na wage subsidies sa micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) upang suportahan ang dagdag P100 kada araw na kita sa loob ng tatlong buwan; Php 40.5 bilyon para sa cash-for-work programs; Php 220 bilyon para sa suportahan ang sektor ng agrikultura; Php 200 bilyon para akayin ang mga MSMEs na itinaguyod ng mga Pilipino; Php 78 bilyon para sa informal earners; Php 200 bilyon para sa COVID-19 health response; at Php 113 bilyon upang pondohan ang distance learning.\nOriginally published in The Catalyst.\n ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Design by Frtizjay Labiano\n  Umaabot ng 365 na araw upang maganap ang …","ref":"/news/10k-ayuda-kalabisan-bang-ibigay-sa-masa/","tags":"","title":"10K ayuda: kalabisan bang ibigay sa masa?"},{"body":" Nagprotesta ang kabataan at iba’t ibang sektor sa Luneta upang gunitain ang ika-47 anibersaryo ng deklarasyon ng Batas militar at irehistro ang kanilang mariing pagkundina sa mga karahasan sa ilalim ng diktadura ni Ferdinand Marcos, noong ika-20 ng Setyembre 2019. (Kuha ni Lucky dela Rosa)\n  Ang taon ay 1896. Hudyat ng pagpunit ng sedula ang simula ng himagsikan laban sa 300-taong pananakop ng Espanya. Pinangunahan ito ni Andres Bonifacio, 28 taong gulang, kasama ang maraming kabataang miyembro ng Katipunan.\nAng taon ay 1970. Sinalubong ang mga unang buwan ng taon ng sunod-sunod at malakihang mga protesta laban sa rehimeng US-Marcos. Pinangunahan ng kabataan ang pagkilos sa mga lungsod at Pamantasan.\nHinubog ng pag-organisa’t pagkilos ng kabataan ang ating kasaysayan. Kaya’t nang palihim na inihimlay ang diktador sa Libingan ng mga Bayani, ipinakita ng kabataan ang kanilang mariing pagtutol. Tulad ng dating lumaban sa diktadura, sama-sama silang lumilikha ng kasaysayan sa lansangan.\n‘Kung hindi tayo kikilos, sino ang kikilos? Kung hindi ngayon, kalian pa?’ Umani ng batikos ang isinigawang protesta ng mga mag-aaral ng St. Scholastica’s College (SSC) laban sa libing ng yumaong diktador. Sa kabila ito ng mga dati nang pagprotesta ng mga “Kulasa” para sa mga Lumad o mga dinukot na batang Nigerian.\nDahil sa kanilang edad at kawalan ng karanasan, madalas na kinukuwestiyon ang kapasidad ng kabataan na unawain ang lipunan at maging bahagi ng diskusyong pulitikal at mga pagkilos. Ngunit taliwas ito sa ating kasaysayan. Sa katunayan, liberal na edukasyon at mga bagong ideya ang nagbigay-daan upang pangunahan ng kabataang Propagandista at Katipunero ang pag-alsa laban sa Espanya.\nSa pag-usbong ng mga bago at radikal na ideya sa mga pamantasan noong dekada ’60, kasabay ng iba pang pagkilos ng kabataan sa iba’t ibang panig ng mundo, muling umigting ang kamalayang makabayan ng kabataang Pilipino. Nagbigay sila ng matalas na pagsipat sa tumitinding kalagayan ng lipunan.\nPinatutunayan lamang nito na kritikal na edukasyon at kamalayan ang laging tumutulak sa kabataan upang harapin at kuwestiyunin ang realidad, at upang makapagsulong sila ng mga progresibong pagbabago kasama ng iba pang mga sektor ng lipunan.\nHindi nakapagtatakang kabataan din ang nanguna sa makasaysayang First Quarter Storm noong 1970 na yumanig sa rehimeng Marcos. Kalauna’y kabataan din, si Liliosa Hilao, ang unang naging biktima ng batas militar, at sinundan ng marami pang kabataang dinukot, tinortyur at pinatay.\nNagpatuloy ang pagtindig at pag-organisa ng maraming kabataan kasama ang uring manggagawa—mula sa pagpapatalsik sa diktador, paglaban kasama ng mga magsasaka, pagpigil sa tuition hike, pagpapatalsik muli sa isang pangulo, planong pagbitay sa isang OFW, at sa maraming isyung mahalaga sa lipunan.\n‘Kapag namulat ka sa katotohanan, kasalanan na ang pumikit.’ Karaniwang ipinagpapalagay ng marami na sagabal sa “edukasyon” ng kabataan ang kanilang pakikilahok sa mga kilos-protesta. Ikinukulong pa rin ang edukasyon sa apat na sulok ng klasrum, pamantayan ng kaalaman ang grado, at ang diploma’y tiket para makapagtrabaho.\nNagiging bangkong walang laman ang isang mag-aaral, ayon sa guro at pilosopong si Paulo Freire sa “Pedagogy of the Oprressed.” Sa “banking model” ng edukasyon, lagi lamang nakabukas ang “bangko” upang pasibong tanggapin ang anumang kaalamang idedeposito ng guro. Kaya ang mga paaralan ay nananatiling espasyo ng kompetisyon at hindi para sa makabuluhang diskurso, at pinananatili lamang ng edukasyon ang karahasan sa lipunan.\nMalayo ito sa radikal at mas makabuluhang tunguhin para sa mga “pag-asa ng bayan” na natunghayan sa kasaysayan. Para kay Freire, mahalaga sa tunay na paglaya ng lipunan ang isang edukasyong huhubog sa kritikal na kamalayan. Hindi na lamang dapat pasibong tagapagmasid at bangko ng impormasyon ang kabataan; kailangang kaya na nilang kilalanin at suriin ang mga isyu ng lipunan.\nPinatunayan ito ng libu-libong mag-aaral na sumama at nanguna sa mga nakaraang kilos-protesta. Bagaman pilit na nililimitahan ang pakikilahok nila sa mga isyu, ipinapakita nila na nananatili ang pagiging mapanuri at kritikal ng kabataan. Hindi pa man ipinapanganak ang mga millennial noong Batas Militar, kaya nilang pumanig sa tamang bersyon ng kasaysayan.\n‘Temperamental brats will change the world!’ Tumataliwas ang ipinakitang pagmobilisa ng kabataan sa katangiang pilit ikinakabit sa “millennials”—indibidwalista at kimi sa mga isyu. Hindi naman sang-ayon si Propesor Sarah Raymundo ng UP Sociology na tawagin pa ring “millennials” ang kabataan.\n“There is no good reason for us to believe that the generation lens, which was originally invented for the study of markets of bourgeois consumption, is a good way to approach political mobilizations organized around revolution,” aniya. Dagdag ni Raymundo, mas tapat na tawaging “petit-bourgeoisie” ang “millennials.”\nBagaman kinikilalang petit-bourgeois ang maraming kabataan, hindi ito nangangahulugang wala silang kakayahang sumama sa pakikibaka ng mamamayan. Mababalikan ang naging pagkakamali ng dating Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP) noong 1930s—ang hindi nito pagtiwala at pagtanggap sa sektor ng mag-aaral dahil sa kanilang burgis na katangian, isang dahilan upang humina ang kilusang kabataan sa harap ng kolonyalismong Amerikano.\nAyon kay Amado P. Guerrero sa Philippine Society and Revolution, mahalaga ang posisyon ng petit-bourgeois—mga may iilang pagmamay-ari tulad ng kabataang estudyante, intelektwal, at propesyunal—dahil sa kanilang kakayahang mag-impluwensya at humubog ng pampublikong diskurso.\nKapansin-pansin sa mga protesta ang malikhaing mga placard: “Magnanakaw AF,” “Hero? ‘Wag ako gurl,” at “Bumagsak man grades ko, ‘wag lang ang bayan ko!” Nagagamit ng kabataang nagtungo sa lansangan ang kanilang lenggwahe, sabihin mang petit-bourgeois, upang itawid ang kanilang mensahe sa mga kapwa-kabataan at isulong ang interes ng mamamayan.\nDagdag ni Guerrero, “The student youth are again among those in the forefront of the propaganda movement of today’s struggle for people’s democracy … They can overcome their weaknesses and shortcomings only by deeply involving themselves in mass struggles over a long period of time.”\nIkinabigla at ikinatuwa naman ng mga biktima ng Batas Militar ang dami ng kabataan na nagprotesta. “Nararamdaman sa kaibuturan ng ating puso ang pagpapanibagong siklab ng pambansang demoktratikong pakikibaka ng kabataan at estudyante,” ani Satur Ocampo, biktima ng Batas Militar at isa sa mga nagtatag ng Kabataang Makabayan.\nAng taon ay 2016. Sa makasaysayang pagsasama-sama ng mamamayan noong Nobyembre 25, ipinasa ng mga dating aktibista at biktima ng Batas Militar ang sulo sa bagong mga lider-kabataan. Para sa bagong salinlahi, nagpapatuloy ang nasimulan.\n Nailathala sa isyu ng Kulê noong ika-10 ng Disyembre, 2016, gamit ang pamagat na “Silid-Aklasan.”\nSi Sanny D. Afable ang punong patnugot ng Kulê noong 2017-2018. Nagtapos siya ng BS Statistics at kasalukyang mag-aaral ng MA Demography sa UP Population Institute.\nOriginally published in Philippine Collegian.\n ","categories":"","description":"Taliwas sa kasaysayan ang pagkwestyon sa kakayanan ng kabataan na unawain ang lipunan.

This focuses on the purpose of the Anti-Terror law, its unconstitutionality and its possible dangers for the masses.\nThere are a total of 37 petitions filed against the said law that were authored by framers of the 1987 Constitution, human rights advocates, lawyers groups, members of the academe, religious organizations, and individuals who have been a victim of red-tagging.\nOSG insists that there are no vague provisions in ATL On May 11, the seventh day of ATL’s oral arguments, the Supreme Court justices raised concerns on the vague provisions of the draconian law, and the possible dangers of the law on red-tagged groups and individuals.\nAssociate Justice Rodil Zalameda asked why the authors of the ATL did not use a “modifier” on the phrase “provoke the government” when the law defined what will acts of terrorism account for.\nHowever, Assistant Solicitor General (ASG) Raymund Rigodon disagreed that the definition of acts of terrorism is vague.\nThe definition of terrorism under the Human Security Act used to specify “predicate crimes” such as piracy, rebellion or insurrection, coup d’etat, murder, kidnapping, arson, hijacking, highway robbery, illegal possession and manufacture of firearms and explosives, and violations of the laws regulating toxic substances and nuclear wastes and atomic energy.\nThis was replaced by some criteria that petitioners deemed unclear, such as acts intended to cause death or injury, damage to property, or using weapons or dangerous substances to “intimidate the general public or a segment thereof, create an atmosphere or spread a message of fear, to provoke or influence by intimidation the government or any international organization, or seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic, or social structures of the country, or create a public emergency or seriously undermine public safety.”\nWith other provisions that punish speech and actions that may be interpreted as supportive of terrorism, the petitioners themselves, human rights advocates and progressive groups pointed out the law might include the traditionally protected form of expression against government’s shortcomings.\n“It is not merely provocation. What I fear about is the phrase ‘provoke the government’ is too vague so as to include any kind of provocation. It did not say that to provoke a government to do or to abstain from doing an act. Just it stated that to provoke the government,” said Zalameda.\nWhen asked by Associate Justice Benjamin Caguioa about who will determine the standard of “creating an atmosphere of fear” Rigodon answered the arresting agents. This was after Rigodon failed to answer the former’s question about his understanding of “atmosphere of fear”.\nThe state forces have the judicial power, for instance in a physical protest, to declare whether the event is indeed “creating an atmosphere of fear”, requiring activists to prove that they do not intend to cause harm.\n“Remember that you are depriving that person a fundamental liberty, a fundamental right to be free, and are you saying that can be done even if there is no standard, or even if that standard is susceptible to different interpretations, as many policemen as there are?” Caguioa said.\nDone process over due process Red tagging an individual, group, organization, or institution mirrors the idea of putting a guilty verdict on them even without substantial proof, which is contrary to the principle of presumption of innocence under 1987 Constitution, Bill of Rights Section 14.\nIt can be remembered that in July 2020, Duterte, during one of his televised pre-recorded speeches, assured the Filipinos they should not be afraid of the ATL if they are not guilty of being a terrorist.\n“For the law-abiding citizen of this country, I am addressing you with all sincerity, do not be afraid if you are not a terrorist.”\nOn the 7th day of ATL oral argument, Rigodon reiterated this. However, this promise has already been used before during the drug war but the campaign still took more than 20,000 lives, targeting mostly poor communities, putting suspects on ‘drug lists’ compiled by local community leaders.\nWhile Sen. Bato Dela Rosa claims that policemen did not want to harm innocent civilians but “shit happens” in an “imperfect world”, the Duterte regime has created a culture of impunity.\nThe innocent lives taken were downgraded into collateral damage, justice is hardly served when the Philippine National Police (PNP) themselves are uncooperative in investigations.\nEven after the promises during the height of his state-sponsored killings, innocent lives were still taken without accountability from the state forces who executed almost instantaneously. Duterte’s empty rhetoric about ‘not being afraid of ATL’ does not guarantee the safety of the public, especially if the draconian law follows ‘done process’ than ‘due process’.\n“Is that enough? Is that enough to allay the fears, the suspicions, the apprehensions, the repugnance of the public? Is lip service enough?” Associate Justice Amy Lazaro-Javier asked Rigodon during the oral argument in relation to their assertion that there is nothing to fear.\nRigodon answered her through reading the law’s regulation policy but he was cut off as Javier rested the case and said, “Please pardon me, but I think the answer is not responsive to my question. So please, I have no time to debate with you on this, so please present this in your memorandum.”\nOn the relentless red-tagging of NTF-ELCAC frontmen Still on the seventh day of the oral arguments, government lawyers were pressed regarding the relentless red-tagging of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC).\nAssociate Justice Javier cited red-tagged partylist groups Gabriela Women’s Party and Kabataan, even when they have never been mentioned in any official resolutions and proclamations as fronts of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People’s Army (CPP-NPA).\n“Does this mean that after all these months of tagging Kabataan and Gabriela as fronts of the CPP and NPA, there is insufficient evidence linking them to said terrorist organizations after all?” she asked.\nASG Marissa dela Cruz-Galandines did not answer and instead deferred to National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr., who was supposed to present himself on the next day of the oral arguments.\nSince the law was passed, activists and journalists have reportedly been labeled “communists,” and “terrorists,” have been threatened, jailed on trumped up charges with planted evidence, tortured, and killed during the execution of “search warrants”.\nThe Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) has argued that NTF-ELCAC spokesperson Lieutenant General Antonio Parlade Jr’s red-tagging on his social media accounts is done in his personal accounts.\nJavier asked if ever the government had disavowed his statements. They did not. The Department of Justice (DOJ) secretary Menardo Guevarra, who is also among the 20 members of the NTF-ELCAC, even deferred to his undersecretary when he was asked whether he stands by the public claims of Parlade and Press Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy regarding the ‘communist links’ of the community pantries.\nIt can be remembered that during Day 6, Galandines told the Supreme Court that red-tagging was a term coined by leftists, and that what the government did was “truth-tagging.”\nAccording to Rappler’s fact-checking report, the terms “red-tagging,” “red tag” or “red-tagged” were already used in writings that involve communism even before Jose Maria Sison founded the CPP in 1968.\nGalandines claimed that “truth-tagging” involves a “comprehensive, detailed and careful evaluation of circumstances before the government comes up with the tagging of a person or organization.”\nNTF-ELCAC did not present any evidence to support their claims that the progressive groups, human rights defenders, activists and union leaders they tagged were indeed part of CPP-NPA.\nThe Anti-Terrorism Council’s unconstitutionality In ATL’s provision, ATC, currently headed by Executive Secretary, have the authority to designate individuals and organizations as terrorists without any hearing, as long as it deems that there is a ‘probable cause’ that they commit any acts defined as terrorism under the Sections 4 to 12. ATC would not have to obtain warrants from the courts to do this.\nPetitioners stressed that the authority vested in ATC violates the Supreme Court’s rule-making power.\nA day after the Day 8 of the oral arguments, the Anti-Terrorism Council released a resolution formally tagging 19 people as terrorists, which include CPP founder Jose Maria Sison and his wife Julieta Sison, National Democratic Front of the Philippines peace consultants Benito Tiamzon, Wilma Tiamzon, Rafael Baylosis, Vicente Ladlad and other alleged members of the CPP.\nThe resolution claims that the 19 listed violated Sections 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.\n“Based on verified and validated information, the ATC found probable cause, as defined in the Anti-Terrorism Act, warranting the designation of the following central committee members of the CPP… for planning, preparing, facilitating, conspiring, and inciting the commission of terrorism and recruitment to and membership in a terrorist organization or a group organized for the purpose of engaging in terrorism,” the resolution read.\nOn Section 27, courts are permitted to declare preliminary groups as terrorists even without a full hearing. If it finds probable cause and finds the petition sufficient in form and substance, it can issue within 72 hours a preliminary order of proscription, meaning people can be declared as terrorists right away.\nThe passage allows the council to label a person a terrorist, without requiring said person the opportunity to present contrary evidence. This is contrary to the Bill of Rights Article III, Sec. 14, which states that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt; and Section 18, which states that no person shall be detained solely by reason of his political beliefs and aspirations and no involuntary servitude in any form shall exist except as a punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\nOn the misconception with communism’s legality Associate Justice Marvic Leonen, on the other hand, pointed out that terrorism goes beyond communist terrorism and communism is not a crime in itself.\nLeonen said to be a communist is not wrong because to be a communist simply “means you believe in the writings of Karl Marx and the communist manifesto.”\nIn 1992, then-President Fidel V. Ramos already repealed the Anti- Subversion Law, a law that made being a member of the CPP illegal.\n“Are we going after those that we deem leftist simply because we feel them as leftist? And contrary to the opinion of others, being leftist is again pejorative, because it reflects on whoever is labeling that person. What if I told you I’m socialist? Am I leftist? What if I told you that in the heart of my hearts, I believe that the ownership of means of production should be in the hands of workers, am I communist?” Leonen asked.\nYet again, the government lawyers could only put a loose end answer with Galandines saying that ideologies should never be punished.\nSenator Drilon files bill to criminalize red-tagging On March 24, Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon filed Senate Bill No. 2121, an Act Defining and Penalizing the Crime of Red-tagging. The Bill seeks to punish red-tagging state agents with up to ten years in prison and disqualification from public office.\nIn the said bill, red-tagging was defined as the “act of labeling, vilifying, branding, naming, accusing, harassing, persecuting, stereotyping, or caricaturing individuals, groups, or organizations as state enemies, left-leaning, subversives, communists, or terrorists as part of a counter-insurgency or anti-terrorism strategy or program, by any state actor, such as law enforcement agent, paramilitary, or military personnel.”\n“The passage of this bill will reverse the ‘increasingly institutionalization and normalization of human rights violations’ and put a stop on the attacks against the members of the legal profession,” Drilon said in the bill’s explanatory note.\nAnyone found guilty will face up to 10 years jail time and disqualification of persons convicted from holding public office.\nIt can be remembered that in February, the senate panel insisted that there is no need to criminalize red-tagging in the Philippines since there are already legal remedies available to an aggrieved party. But after the Senate employees’ unions were accused of having communist links, Senate President Vicente Sotto III expressed his support for the bill against red-tagging.\n“Victims are left without proper recourse against their perpetrators and are forced to file seemingly-appropriate-but-not-quite-cases, like libel and grave threats,” Drilon said.\nFor petitioners and supporters of junking ATL, libel cases, writ of habeas data and writ of amparo are not enough for the protection of the victims because they do not get the right and adequate justice. Red-tagging has already killed several people and therefore protection and justice for the victims must be served.\nActivism and communism are not crimes, as the Anti-Subversion Law was repealed in 1992. In the culture of impunity Duterte has created, attacks and trumped up charges against human rights defenders, journalists, activists and the masses continue to prevail. The red-tagging spree of state forces mouthpieces against the critics of the government is a clear violation of the Section 4 of the Bill of Rights. Anti-Terror Law only grants the regime excessive and unchecked powers that further jeopardise democracy.\nOriginally published in The Catalyst.\n ","categories":"","description":"Utilize education to express.

(Photo from PPC)\n  Many things have been said about this university. Many things have been written about what’s wrong with it, like the alleged Americanization and the DOW contracts and the very large deficit. But of all that has been said and written, none has made mention of a situation that casts a shadow of doubt on the measure of our institutions as a university and could seriously challenge its claims to excellence.\nOne of the very obvious—and therefore cry much taken for granted—functions of the university is to serve as a place where minds meet, a place where there is a free intercourse of ideas, where one can integrate the bits of information he has gathered into meaningful and functional knowledge. The inadequacy of our university becomes evident in this aspect. There is no such meeting of minds, no traffic of ideas between the scientists and the non-scientists in this university. There is no evidence at all of any attempt at integration: The scientist and the non-scientist simply cannot understand each other. They do not communicate.\nWorse, none has expressed an awareness of this problem. Until very recently.\nNeglect Three issues ago, an English major wrote that science has been neglected in the university. Neglect, meaning dilapidated laboratories equipped with obsolescent apparatus because very little of the P15-lab-fee-per-student really is spent on the laboratories. Neglect, also meaning apathy on the part of the non-scientists—those who are in the arts, social sciences, and humanities, with regard to the needs of the scientists, those in the natural sciences. Take, for example. R.A. 3887, better known as the Natural Science Research Center law, establishing such a center “pursuant to the national policy of promoting scientific research and invention in the Philippines.”\nWhile in the last campus elections most of the political parties promised to work for its immediate implementation, it would still be too presumptuous for one to consider such pledges as a genuine sign of awareness and concern. For there is more reason to believe that these were merely shrewd political gimmicks aimed at carrying the science votes. The indifference of the non-scientists was best displayed when a rally was staged to demand more concrete action on the establishment of the research center. Only a handful of students—all from the sciences—joined the rally. The non-science students, having ignored the invitation to join the scientists in this cause, were busy “minding their own business,” as if science were not their business.\nYet neglect does not seem to be a very accurate word, for it would appear to lay blame only on the non-scientists and say nothing of the scientists. Which is quite unfair, because the scientists are just as guilty as the non-scientists and both are to blame. Or maybe neither.\nResponsible Scientists We are surprised, for example, how the controversies on the DOW Chemicals and USAF contracts could have passed without a single word of comment from the scientists. Or how such silence could have passed unnoticed by the non-scientists. We can understand—but not necessarily justify—why the scientists would reserve the right to comment on the alleged consent to and participation in a cruel and inhuman and irrational war and American imperialism, which to them may appear trivial and inconsequential. But that was not all there was to the protest. There was also the issue of the manner in which man, through technology, makes use of scientific discoveries and how responsible a scientist is when lives and property are destroyed by the products of his research. On these issues, the scientists cannot afford to be silent. For their silence can only be taken as irrefutable proof of their lack of awareness, and their lack of awareness to mean a lack of responsibility, if not ignorance.\nIt is perhaps understandable why there is such a mutual I-don’t-care attitude. The experiences non-scientists have in the sciences are not exactly very pleasant. These include, among others, noxious fumes from the chem labs, the fishy, nauseating odor from the zoology pavilion, some sleepy lecture hours in a physics class, plus a number of irritating habits of eccentric would-be scientists. The scientists, on the other hand, are reminded of equally traumatic experiences in their non-science classes: uninteresting readings in western thought, uninspiring short stories and meaningless poetry, and the intolerable inaccuracy and unbearable subjectivity of the non-science students and other teachers.\nIvory towers Or it is highly probable that the scientist-in-ivory-tower mentality still prevails in the university. Long ago, the scientist enjoyed the reputation of one who was quite different from and in fact superior to the rest of humanity. It was believed that his sole responsibility to society was to perform experiments and do scientific research. He was therefore allowed to retreat to some cold, isolated ivory tower where he could best perform his function, undisturbed and uncontaminated by the rest of human activity. For a long time, this arrangement worked. Man took full advantage of the discoveries of the scientist-in-the-ivory-tower and enjoyed all the conveniences made possible by advances in scientific research. And all was well.\nThe prevalence of this attitude can probably explain the present situation in this university, where there is this mutual mind-your-own-business attitude—where the non-scientists would leave the scientists alone in their ill-lit, poorly ventilated cloisters, where the latter dissect cats and dogfish, or verify physical laws, or contemplate some complex structural formula, refusing to have anything to do with dirty politics, dull literature, and fresh air.\nBut this concept cannot be justified, nor can it be tolerated. It cannot be tolerated because it is very old and obsolete. And wrong.\nIn 1945, the atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing thousands of human beings, leaving miles and miles of scorched wasteland, posing a threat of annihilation to mankind. And destroying that ivory tower. After the second world war, the scientists could no longer hide behind their cloak of objectivity and unconcern. For the first time the scientists felt guilt. And as Oppenheimer himself described their feeling of troubled concern, “they have known sin.”\nCooperation From this guilt came a sense of responsibility. The scientists realized that their responsibility to mankind was not only to make scientific discoveries, but also to prepare man for it, so that he may not use it to destroy himself. It is their responsibility to teach science because science could be taught—to correct the misconceptions of the non-scientists by teaching science as a method, and not as a doctrine, by showing that despite its being a powerful tool, science has its limitations.\nThe non-scientists, too, have their responsibilities. They should know science and learn it because it could be learned. And because handling a potentially destructive weapon of which one is ignorant ends in self destruction. It is their responsibility, further, to humanize the sciences because the sciences have become dehumanized—and inhumane.\nThere was therefore a need for communication for a meeting of minds, for a free traffic of ideas between the two, so that they may perform their tasks, and save mankind.

Hindi man kami mayaman sa materyal na bagay, punung-puno naman kami ng yaman sa paggalang at pagmamahalan. (Dibuho ni Kent Ivan Florino)\n  Malakas tumawa, masayahin—animo’y walang iniindang kalungkutan. Pero kung ako’y nag-iisa at sa tuwing nananalamin, marami akong katanungan sa sarili. Tumanda akong hindi buo, marami ang kulang sa akin. ‘Yan ang malungkot na parte ng buhay ko na hindi ko maitatanggi. Hindi ko man lang nakilala o nakita ang aking tatay at lumaki ako sa pangangalaga ng tiyahin ko. Namasukan ako, kapalit ng pag-aaral ko.\nUhaw na uhaw ako sa pagmamahal ng isang ama, uhaw sa pagmamahal ng isang buong pamilya. Kaya sa tuwing makakakita ako noon ng isang buo ang pamilya, inggit na inggit ako at naiiyak. Pero tamang punas lang ng luha at sasabihin sa sarili, “Sila ‘yun, iba ka.” Gano’n lagi. Hindi ko rin naranasan noong bata ako ang maglaro sa labas, ang maging malaya.\nBata pa lang ako, kailangan ko na magtrabaho para makapag-aral at kailangan ko paghirapan ang binibigay sa aking baon na limang piso araw-araw. Pagkaminsan, may isang piraso ng nilagang saba—ayun lang, sapat na.\nNairaos ko ang elementarya na gano’n ang sistema ng buhay ko. Paulit-ulit umiikot ang buhay ko sa eskwela at bahay ng tita ko. Hindi nila alam kung paano ko nairaos ang mga kailangan ko sa eskwela at mga project. Dumiskarte ako dahil may mga tamad akong kaklase noon at ako ang gumagawa ng mga assignment nila, at may bayad silang masarap na pagkain kinabukasan. Baon-baon ko ang diskarteng ‘yun hanggang high school.\nHindi naman kaila sa mga guro at kaeskwela ko ang katayuan ko sa buhay noon, bagkus hinahangaan pa nga nila ako. Ayun nga lang, nalulungkot ang mga guro ko kapag kailangan akong sabitan ng medalya at walang magulang na pumupunta para sa akin. Naiiyak man ako, pero kailangan kong maging matatag dahil ako lang ang makakatulong sa sarili ko. Natuto akong lumaban sa buhay nang mag-isa.\nMatapos ang yugto ng buhay ko sa high school, hindi na ako nakapagkolehiyo. Tinamad ako, napagod at nawala sa diskarte. Nabarkada sa hindi maganda, nakapag-asawa nang maaga. Hindi ko magawang sisihin ang sarili sa mga maling desisyon ko. Sadyang wala lang akong masandalan noong mga panahong kailangan ko ng masasandalan. Ipinangako ko sa sarili ko na kapag bumuo ako ng pamilya, hindi ako magkukulang—bubusugin ko ang mga anak ko sa pagmamahal. Sisikapin kong hindi nila maranasan ang mga dinanas ko.\nKahit sobrang naiiyak sila kapag kinukwento ko ang mga pinagdaanan ko, lagi kong sinasabi na iyon ang halimbawa ng hindi pagtatanim ng sama ng loob dahil ngayon, nakikita nila kung paano ko mahalin at alagaan ang nanay ko kapag nasa akin siya. Kaya sobrang mahal nila lola nila. Nanay ko siya at nag-iisa lang siya. Ayoko nang isumbat pa sa kanya ang mga pinagdaanan ko. Ang mahalaga ay ‘yung ngayon na dapat ay maging masaya.\nNgayong isa na akong nanay, buo na ako. Binuo ako ng mga anak ko. Ginagawa ko ang lahat para maging isang mabuting ina sa kanila. Hindi man kami mayaman sa materyal na bagay, punung-puno naman kami ng yaman sa paggalang at pagmamahalan. Nakakaranas man ako ng hindi magagandang alaala, napapalitan naman ang mga ito ng mga masaya’t makulay at puno ng pag-asa.\nLumaki man akong hindi buo, at least ngayon, maipagmamalaki ko ang binuo kong pamilya.

I can honestly claim that for much of my writing life, my views were my own, unshackled and free. I’ve tried my very best to sustain that freedom till now. Sure, I have biases–all of us do–but these are not shaped in an imprisoned mind.\nI have no properties that own me–just this house in Project 8 and this little bookshop in Padre Faura. My National Artist stipend of P50,000 a month, The Philippine STAR fee for my Monday column the occasional honoraria for my lectures and the 30 percent of all sales in my bookshop allow me a decent living. Thank God we have seven children who will not allow my wife and me to go hungry if we go bankrupt.\nI never had social or political ambition. All I really wanted to do was to write, to compete with the world’s best whose works I had admired. Ambition? Yes, I wanted to be this country’s best novelist. In this goal, no one can really help me. It is an effort, solitary and self-consuming but come to think of it, so spiritually satisfying; in the end, I realized, it was my own self I was competing with. Vanquish the ego when I edit myself, when I yield to compassion, to others.\nPublic charity But I must be charitable with myself first before I offer help to others. This thought comes to mind as charitable-initiatives like the Community Pantry are very much in the news this week. Charity to one’s self is not pampering one’s self. It means being kind to one’s self, to admit our faults and forgive ourselves, to admit human frailty and likewise forgive those who did us wrong. Of course, I’ve always known the institutionalized do-gooding of the Catholic Church, but it is so rich, it could do much much more, set up soup kitchens for the hungry, shelter for the homeless. And all those billionaires. In this pandemic, why haven’t they donated vaccines by the millions?\nOur political leaders But while I was never interested in a political career, I was fascinated by our politicians and the political process, particularly how our political leaders failed. As a writer I got to know some of them not as politicians but as men of clay.\nWhen I came to Manila in 1938 to attend high school, the flamboyant Manuel Quezon was already in Malacañan. We knew him as a playboy. He fled to the United States in 1942 to lead the government in exile. He died there. The presidents who succeeded Quezon – Osmeña, Roxas and Quirino – all belonged to the old school of political leaders who relied on their parties to propel them to power. Ramon Magsaysay is the first candidate for president to change this by going directly to the people. He was a game changer. After him, Garcia, then Macapagal. They were ordinary with occasional flashes of vision – Filipino first for Garcia, regionalism for Macapagal.\nThen Marcos who ruled longest and had the most impact on society and politics, and after him Cory who was a disaster and her son, Noynoy. Cory was “mata pobre.” The Mendiola massacre of peasant demonstrators shortly after she assumed power illustrated her callousness, as did her son in his response to the Yolanda disaster and the Mamasapano slaughter. Fidel V. Ramos – he is the only president who should have modernized the Armed Forces – this was his greatest failing whose result bedevils us today as China slowly nibbles our sovereignty. And Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, I owe her my National Artist Award; next to Marcos, her regime was longest, lackluster and marred by the “Hello, Garci” scandal.\nIn assessing our politicians and their performance, I don’t rely just on what I see on TV, Facebook or commentaries in the newspapers. I have informants, some of them academics or technocrats. It’s so easy to validate information; all Filipinos are open and they love to talk. I never met Ramon Ang, the tycoon who Danding Cojuangco named his heir, but I have heard so many good things he is doing not just for his people. There is a call for him to run for president next year. If he does and he wins, I am sure he won’t be a local version of Donald Trump.\nDuterte’s star Now, here is a forecast worth betting on. It may turn out that for all his vulgar language, Rodrigo Roa Duterte may yet be, next to Magsaysay, the best president we ever had. All the criticisms considered, just remember this – the country is far safer now than at any other time. And inspite of the poverty, the economy is sure to recover; our foreign reserves are the highest ever. So much infrastructure has been built to hasten development – and this, too, is coming as more and more landlords are becoming producers. The Moro rebellion, I hope, will now wind down as the Moros themselves realize development will assure them peace. As for the communists, their terrorist front, the New People’s Army, is now under attack. I hope it is demolished soon.\nThe Communist Party was decriminalized by President Ramos, but no politician wants to proclaim himself a communist. So, the party has many front organizations. All should be identified. Communist parties exist in Western Europe, in Japan but these parties don’t have front organizations engaged in armed revolt. Thousands have died and billions lost in this protracted war that is now more than 50 years. It is time the response of the State must be conclusive.\nOpportunists What aggravates the communist rebellion are the opportunists in Congress, in media, the business sector and politicians who curry favor for the communists’ support and for self-protection; they will cease doing this when they are convinced it is no longer necessary or profitable to do so.\nSearch for meaning Sometime in our lives, we ask these questions: who am I, where am I going? In this my twilight, I have mulled over these questions and more – why am I writing? Of what use is Art? Why Freedom? And above all, have I given this mundane life any meaning? As for that lofty literary goal, it is honor enough to be nominated to the Nobel, but at 96, I know I’ll not get it. My spirit always lifts though whenever I recall what Tim Kindseth of Time magazine said, that my Rosales novels are “rivaled only by Rizal’s Noli and Fili.”\nOriginally published in Philippine Star.\n ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"“Only those with independent means can afford independent views.” …","ref":"/news/independence-sionil-jose/","tags":"","title":"Independence"},{"body":"  Fireworks of a different kind exploded last April 27 when politicians commented on the 500th anniversary of the Victory in Mactan. Cavite Vice Gov. Jolo Revilla posted on FB: “A salute to the bravery of one of the first heroes of the nation, Ferdinand Magellan, who gave his life for freedom 500 years ago!” Called out by netizens, Revilla blamed an “intern” who supposedly posted on his FB page without clearance.\nThere was also clickbait from presidential spokesperson Harry Roque: “President Rodrigo Roa Duterte is my modern day Lapulapu, especially his independent foreign policy. It means that we are friends to all, we have no enemies, he doesn’t shy away before any foreigner.”\nBut the winner is Sen. Bong Go, who doused the once-in-500-years jubilation of Cebuanos by declaring that Lapulapu was a Tausug! Worse, Lapulapu, Raja of Mactan, was reduced to a warrior sent by the Sultan of Sulu to confirm reports of foreigners in Cebu. Go cited a certain Abraham Idjirani as his source. Idjirani is an engineer, not a historian. He served as the spokesperson of the self-proclaimed Sultan of Sulu, who died in Taguig in 2013.\nFor the record, the primary source for Lapulapu and the Battle of Mactan is not a Pinoy but an Italian—Antonio Pigafetta, chronicler of the Magellan expedition. Our story begins on April 26, 1521, when the son of Zula, minor chief of Mactan, presented two goats to Magellan. Zula, apologizing, said he could send more, if not for “the other chief Cilapulapu, who refused to obey the king of Spain.” Zula requested from Magellan a boatload of men to help him fight Cilapulapu. Against his better judgment and the advice of his officers, Magellan set off at midnight with a force of 60 men. They were accompanied by the “Christian King” Carlos (who was Humabon before baptism), with 20 or 30 balanghai (about 450-500 Cebuano warriors) as back-up.\nArriving in “Matan” (Spanish for “they kill”) three hours before dawn, Magellan issued an ultimatum to Lapulapu and his men: Obey the Spanish king, recognize the Christian King as their sovereign, and pay tribute. “Otherwise, wait and see how our lances wounded.” Lapulapu’s insolent reply: “We have lances of bamboo and stakes hardened with fire.” Magellan foolishly agreed to fight in the morning at Lapulapu’s request. Magellan assumed that Lapulapu was buying time to dig pits in between their houses for the Europeans to fall into. He did not consider the low tide in the morning, which meant Magellan’s ships could not get close enough for cannon fire to cover them. Ignorant of the terrain, his three boats were impeded by rocks and coral, making their crossbows too far out of range to be useful. From the original 60 men that set off, 49 jumped into the water, leaving 11 to guard the boats. Magellan told Humabon and his 30 balanghais not to intervene as his 60 men supposedly sufficed to subdue Mactan. He was in for a big disappointment.\nMagellan divided his landing force of 49 into three divisions and were pitted, by Pigafetta’s reckoning, against 1,500 Mactanons. Common sense, which is not common, should have told Magellan to retreat as he was outnumbered 31 to one. Their arrows were deflected by native shields, and bullets from their muskets would not hit Mactanons who “would never stand still, but leaped hither and thither.” When a shower of arrows, wooden stakes, and bamboo spears, some with iron tips, rained upon them, Magellan ordered his men “to burn (20 to 30 of) their houses to terrify them (but) they were roused to greater fury.”\nMagellan and his men were half-armored, protected only by helmet and breast plate. They waded waist-deep in unfamiliar waters while the Mactanons aimed at their legs. Hit in the leg by a poisoned arrow, Magellan ordered a slow retreat. All but six or seven ran for their lives back to the boats. Mactanons ganged up on Magellan; one knocked his helmet off, another hurled a spear in his face. Magellan was drawing his sword halfway when he was cut in the left leg by a cutlass that caused him to fall face down. Surrounded and outnumbered, he was finished off by spears and cutlasses.\nDescribed by one source as an old man, Lapulapu was far from the beautiful half-naked man with six-pack abs memorialized in monuments. He did not kill Magellan in hand-to-hand combat as we imagine. He was not in the thick of the fight, but to him is credited the victory for this mismatched battle.

(NHK)\n  As Japanese lawmakers debate revisions to the country’s immigration law, protesters - including asylum seekers, their supporters and lawyers - have been marching through Tokyo to oppose the proposals which they claim are cruel and inhumane. A United Nations panel shares their concerns about the forcible deportation of asylum seekers, lack of judicial review, and the imposition of criminal penalties on people who fail to comply with expulsion orders.\nThe revisions are designed to address the long-term detention of some foreigners. Deaths in custody have highlighted the plight of detainees, including the cases of a Sri Lankan woman who died at an immigration facility in Nagoya last month and a Nigerian man who took up a hunger strike to protest long-term detention in 2019 in Nagasaki Prefecture.\nMost foreigners who are issued deportation orders by Japan’s Immigration Services Agency comply and leave the country. But those who do not are taken into custody. This includes asylum seekers. The agency says it accepted about one percent of refugee applications in 2020.\nPetition gathers 40,000 signatures One of the groups leading the protest campaign is Posse, which is run largely by people in their teens and 20s. The non-profit, based in Tokyo and Miyagi Prefecture, provides consultation services for foreign workers, students, technical trainees and asylum seekers.\nPosse launched an online petition in both Japanese and English urging lawmakers to scrap the draft revision. It gathered over 40,000 signatures in two months. On April 14, about 20 volunteers, mostly university students, presented the petition to immigration officials.\nThey also outlined their concerns about the current proposals.\nUniversity student Iwamoto Nana does volunteer work in support of young Kurdish asylum seekers in Saitama Prefecture out on provisional release. One of them is the same age as her and has become a friend.\n“My friend has already applied for refugee status three times,” she says. “If the draft revision is passed, she could be forcibly deported, criminalized, and her life could be endangered.”\nIwamoto notes that many others face similar situations. She says asylum seekers in Japan “are part of our society, living together with us. We should never reach a situation where their lives are taken over; they are criminalized, and excluded from our society.”\nJapan’s standpoints The draft revision would allow for the forcible deportation of asylum seekers who have applied for refugee status three or more times. Criminal penalties would be imposed if they failed to comply with deportation orders. This is designed to stop people making repeated applications in a bid to stall the process.\nThe changes, which aim to reduce the number of foreigners in detention, would permit some people on the deportation list to stay with family members or supporters until they leave the country.\nA United Nations Human Rights Council on Arbitrary Detention panel issued a statement last month that maintains the Japanese proposal “falls short of international human rights standards.” The working group that considered the draft revision found that the basic policy of using detention in the deportation process is unchanged. Members are concerned that some migrants would remain in custody for limitless periods without judicial review.\nThe UN statement points out that the revision allowing for the forcible deportation of people who have had their refugee status application denied three or more times could be a violation of international law. According to Japan’s Justice Minister Kamikawa Yoko, the criticisms are misplaced.\n“The draft revision was studied by a panel of experts, including international legal scholars, lawyers and NGO officials,” she says. “If the UN panel had a chance to hear explanations by the Japanese government in advance, it would have correctly understood the background, content and appropriateness of the revision.”\nThe way forward Posse leader Iwahashi Makoto says his group is looking beyond the current battle: “Many young people are showing interest in issues facing foreigners. They oppose the draft revision and feel angry about human rights violations.”\n“Abolishing the draft revision is not enough. We will continue to oppose it, and join forces to seek a guarantee for foreigners - including asylum seekers - of the universal human right to live without fear of deportation or poverty. We will demand the government allows them to access social security as they don’t have a safety net.”\nOriginally published in NHK World-Japan.\n ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Posse volunteers submitted a petition with 40,348 signatures to …","ref":"/news/protest-campaign-targets-japan-immigration-law-reform/","tags":"","title":"Protest campaign targets Japan immigration law reform"},{"body":" Bawat bagay ay may kanya-kanyang panahon; panahon ng pagsilang at paghihirap, panahon ng pagkamatay at ginhawa. Ito ang oras ng pagluluksa, ngunit ito rin ang oras ng pagbangon. (Midnight Believer / Flickr)\n  Ito ang natutunan ko sa mga ospital, matapos ang ilang buwang pagdalaw kay Lolo: Sa tingin ko’y may takdang oras ang mga pasyente, at ang takdang ito ang makapagsasabi sa tsansa nilang gumaling. Kung ikaw ay lumaya sa pagkakapiit sa kama at maputulan ng posas ng mga nakakabit na IV bago ang markadong oras, tiyak ang iyong kalusugan. Ngunit kapag lumampas ka sa takdang panahon ng paglaya, may sentensya kang kamatayan sa hinihigaan.\nSinentensyahan na ang lolo ko, at isang taon makalipas, sinentensyahan na rin ang nag-iisa niyang lalaking anak. Masyado nang matagal si Lolo sa ospital, at bagaman sa bawat dalaw ay kailangan naming maging tagapagdala ng kasiyahan at buhay, alam kong sa bawat dagdag na araw na inilalagi niya roon at sa bawat Linggong bumibisita ako ay kabawasan sa pag-asang makakaalis pa siya. Di nagtagal, sinabi na rin ng mga doktor na wala na silang magagawa; masyado nang malala ang kanser, at hindi kakayanin ng kanyang katawan ang anumang operasyon.\nWala na ring magagawa ang mga magulang ko, maging ang mga kapatid at pinsan ng nanay ko. Hindi lang mga maysakit ang nakakaramdam ng kabigatan sa tuwing hinahatulan sila. May kakaibang bigat din ito para sa pamilya dahil sa huli, sila ang mawawalan, maiiwanan kung maipagkakait ang alagang kailangan ng pasyente. Ngunit wala kang magagawa kung ubos na ang kaya mong ibigay. At minsan, ang kabigatan sa pagkawala ng mahal sa buhay ay kaalwanan sa kanilang natitira sa mundo.\nTahimik ang lolo ko at hindi niya gusto ang atensyon noon pang malakas siya, at dinala niya ito hanggang sa magkasakit at maratay siya sa kama. Marahil nasa lahi ang ganitong ugali; tumanggi rin ang tito kong pagkagastusan siya nang siya naman ang magkasakit isang taon makalipas mamatay si Lolo. Siya rin kasi ang sanay na magbigay; lahat ng kita sa abroad ay ipinapadala sa pamilya, at may mga pagkakataong siya pa ang hihingi ng paumanhin kapag walang naibibigay sa aking allowance o load.\nMarahil malay siyang nauubos na rin ang kayang ibigay ng kanyang mga kapatid, lalo’t hindi pa sila nakakabawi sa mga inutang at ginastos kay Lolo noong nakaraang taon. Kaya sa pagpapasya at pagtanggap ng tito ko, at marahil ng lolo, na igugol ang natitirang panahon sa kanilang bahay, hindi lang siguro kalayaan mula sa pananakit ng mga kalamnan ang idinalangin niya, kundi pati paglaya ng kanyang mga kaanak sa pagod at paghihirap, matugunan lang ang kanyang pangangailangan.\nKasalanan ba, kung sa pagkakataong malaman mong ihininga na nila ang huli ay siya namang pagbuga mo ng ginhawa? Nariyan ang hinagpis na wala na silang bumuhay sa’yo at nakasama mo, nariyan ang pangungulila sa pagkakaroon ng tila malaking butas sa pamumuhay magmula sa araw na ito. Ngunit posible kaya, na kapag sinasabi nating, “Salamat at hindi na siya nahihirapan,” ay sinasabi natin ito sa ating sarili? Nakakalungkot isiping wala na akong bibisitahin tuwing Linggo, ngunit may kagaanan sa kawalan ng iisiping bayarin sa ospital at mga gamot.\nKung minsan, ang kagaanan ay hindi lang dahil malaya na tayo sa mga pang-ekonomikong aspeto ng kanilang pananatiling buhay. Ang kaalwanan ay maaari ring dahil hindi na natin sila kailangang isipin o problemahin. May mga pagkakataong tayong mga maiiwan ang nangangailangan ng kalayaan mula sa kanila.\nSa pagkamatay ng nakababatang kapatid ng aking ama, matapos ang pagkatakot, dahil nalaman kong ako pala ang huli niyang nakasalamuha bago atakihin sa puso, ay pakiramdam ng ginhawa. Ginugol ng tito ko ang kalakhan ng kanyang buhay nang lulong sa alak. Kapag may tama’y wala sa sarili kaya hindi pinapapasok sa bahay; at kung hindi lasing, naghahanap ito ng maipapambili ng bote o di kaya’y nangangapitbahay, nangangapit-inuman sa kabilang barangay. Hindi ko siya ginustong mamatay, at maging mga kapatid niyang tinitiis na lang siya ay hindi rin ito gustong mangyari. Ngunit sa totoo lang, tila maging siya ay wala na ring tinitingnan pang matinong kapalaran.\nGusto natin, at gagawin natin ang lahat ng paraan mapanatili lang na buhay ang minamahal, ngunit kung masyado nang mabigat, tingin ko’y hindi naman nila tayo masisisi. O kung hindi man, at galit nga sila dahil sa mga naramdaman ko, malaya silang parusahan ako, ipadama sa akin ang naranasan nila.\nGanoon siguro talaga kapag limitado ka. Palagay ko’y hindi ko naman ito maisusulat kung may sapat kaming yaman upang maipagamot sa pinakamagagandang pasilidad ang mga kaanak at magkaroon pa rin ng sapat na pera para naman sa sarili naming kinabukasan. Marahil ang madaling pagtanggap sa kamatayan ay bunsod na rin ng pagmimistulang normal ng mga pagkawala ngayong may pandemya. Sa sunod-sunod na pagkamatay ng dating mga kaibigan at mga kakilala dahil sa hindi matugunang krisis, mas dama natin ang pagiging limitado. Kaya madaling tanggapin ang pagkawala, ngunit mananatili minsan ang poot dahil wala tayong nagawa para sa kanila.\nAng sabi, pantay-pantay ang lahat sa kamatayan, ngunit maiiba siguro ako. Maaaring iisa ang kahahantungan ng lahat, ngunit hindi pare-pareho ang estado ng mga taong iiwanan natin. Ang mayayaman marahil, kapag namatay, ay mamamatay nang walang alinlangan. Ngunit para sa aming nangangailangang ibuhos ang lahat ng ari-arian sa pagpapagamot sa pamilyang mawawala rin, lilisan siguro sila nang may pangamba at baka sisihin pa ang sarili dahil iiwan niya ang pamilyang ubos na.\nOriginally published in the Philippine Collegian.\n ","categories":"","description":"Nang mamatay ang mga kaanak ko, bago ang pagluluksa ay nakaramdam ako ng ginhawa.

(Richard Madelo/Presidential Photo)\n  For all the grim polls and hectoring public health advisories, the Philippines has hardly even had to contend with vaccine hesitancy, which many government officials have for months flagged as a major challenge to combating the coronavirus. But the scale of such a problem is yet to be seen at this point, really, when the object of speculation has scarcely materialized. So far it is not the public attitude to vaccines that is at issue, when the government, by their own dawdling and bungling, does a better job than any conspiracy theory at losing what little confidence the people have in the vaccination program.\nVaccine skeptics make for an easy punching bag, though. “May mga iba d’yan na ayaw talaga magbakuna. E, di okay na lang ‘yan sa akin. Ang problema kung makahawa ka,” President Rodrigo Duterte said in a televised speech, April 15. He dissed them and told them to die five times.\nDuterte offered a lecture on how to get away with a botched job. First, as in an April 13 speech, he deflected the blame, through cartoonish, frenzied fallacies, to boogeymen and scapegoats only Duterte could think to bring up: communists, whose opposition to the national ID system he claimed to have hampered the pandemic response; flying voters, who he said made it harder for local governments to parcel out COVID-19 aid; and the United States and company that are “refusing to understand or causing problems for other nations.” It did not take long for vaccine skeptics to go on Duterte’s chopping block.\nNext, the president had members of the national task force on COVID-19 flaunt facts and figures so carefully picked out to paint a picture of efficiency and competence. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. reported, during Duterte’s pre-recorded meeting with Cabinet members on April 19, that the country ranked third in Southeast Asia, just behind Indonesia and Singapore, in terms of the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered, as per data from Bloomberg and the Foreign Service Posts.\n“Maganda ang record natin despite unfounded criticisms… to think people were almost in a quandary where to get the next vaccination,” Duterte said. “Nakita mo naman, hindi pala tayo yung pinakamahina.”\nYet the numbers are only as impressive as the government’s effort to skate over its ineptitude and the magnitude of the challenge at hand. The roughly 3.025 million doses delivered to the Philippines, as of April 17, make up only about two percent of the government’s target of 148 million vaccine doses to procure. Granted the administration has eight more months to keep pace with its own timeline, it should still have, by now, gathered enough momentum to roll out the six batches of vaccines already on hand.\nWe cannot fault officials for setting an ambitious goal, but nor can we congratulate them on a pandemic response so riddled with missteps and mistakes. While the economy craters and Filipinos grow restive, the Duterte administration has found itself navigating bureaucratic mazes of its own making and, along the way, failed to leap on vaccine deals that could have gotten the country to the front of the queue.\nRich countries have indeed tended to corner and stockpile COVID-19 vaccine supplies that are nowhere near enough to satisfy the global demand, notwithstanding regulatory hurdles and shortages of raw ingredients and machinery. Duterte struck a similar note, if erroneously, when, in February, he blamed the European Union for holding AstraZeneca doses hostage despite the country’s exemption from the bloc’s export control. “We are not rich,” he said. “This is a fight among the highest bidders who can pay first.”\nEven before this mad scramble, however, the government had already thrown away a shot at first dibs. It sat for almost five months, since June, on a confidentiality data agreement, the first in a bunch of paperwork to sort out prior to any vaccine purchase deal with Pfizer, a frontrunner in the vaccine race. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III has since defended the delay with confused references to a supposedly thorough back-and-forth between Pfizer and Philippine officials and to documents shuttled between “relevant technical offices,” as he so told ANC’s Headstart in December.\nBut to chalk red tape up to a matter of erring on the side of caution, like Duque maintained, flies in the face of the deadly tradeoffs of such wavering. Other countries long anticipated the sort of panic-buying and marauding that had frayed global supply chains during the pandemic’s height. They clinched late-stage vaccine candidates, though they might strike out with several of their purchases, with most jabs’ efficacy still up in the air. Dud vaccines, after all, could just be tossed out. They would always be much cheaper than the possibly millions more lives squandered if there were no vaccines to go around at all as new surges and virus variants cropped up.\nMeanwhile, for all Duterte’s insistence that only vaccines could rescue us from a life in lockdown, the Philippine government refused to go big. Its war chest would only pay for where there is a chance at profit and power play, as in big-ticket infrastructure projects and militarist campaigns. We are not deficient in funding, what with P75 billion of the P82.5 billion budget for vaccines in 2021 already “in place,” according to the Department of Finance in January. Much of it will come from international financial institutions like the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, on top of the funds allocated under Bayanihan 2 and this year’s P4.5-trillion national budget.\nCommitments from multilateral lenders may foot the bill for advance payments to their vaccine makers of choice. This would skirt the 15-percent limit on advance payments, consistent with the government procurement rules, that had precluded both the Duterte administration and local authorities from paying at least 50 percent of advance market commitments that pharmaceuticals require for vaccine reservations. Only in February, after much prodding, did Duterte sign an order lifting such a cap.\n“We have to queue, and we are last to queue because of our failure to make the advance payments early enough,” Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon told ANC’s Headstart in February. “Just like the way the COVID-19 pandemic was handled, there’s mismanagement in the handling of the supply agreements.”\nDrilon belied what pandemic managers pointed out, then, as a bottleneck with Congress and the Senate in passing a bill for an indemnification fund and a “no-fault” clause as part of the negotiations with the World Health Organization (WHO) and Gavi, two of the organizations leading the COVAX facility, a global vaccine-sharing pool. Galvez and Duque, as well as presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, separately imputed the stalled COVAX-facilitated shipment of Pfizer’s coronavirus shots, in mid-February, to the manufacturer’s allegedly last-minute demand for indemnification to preempt lawsuits similar to what the Aquino administration had pursued against another drug company, Sanofi, over the Dengvaxia scare.\nYet it was Galvez who failed to alert lawmakers to the urgency of COVAX prerequisites of which the WHO and Gavi, as early as November, had already informed all participating countries. They were not picking on the Philippines. Our task force negotiators simply exercised no due diligence, let alone assumed any sense of accountability for gaffes that cost us time and resources we could barely eke out.\nAccountability is, however, a tall order for a president who has shunned political acumen and appears just as lost about the policies he himself has signed into law. “I think we cannot even do that even if we wanted to, assuming liability for the stuff bought by the provinces. Tell them it cannot be,” Duterte told Galvez in a March 22 speech, rejecting the concept of liability shields in tripartite agreements. By then, however, he had already signed off on a bill ratified by Congress providing for just exactly that.\nThe odds of weathering this public health crisis sane and unscathed can swing either way, depending on one man’s caprices and comprehension of risks and reality at any given time. Though we can, and must, brave out the pandemic, through sheer will and mutual aid, if nothing else, the more lingering emergency is what Duterte represents and has set out to foment and leave behind as soon as the dust settles.\nEven now, his allies in the national pandemic response team, who may remain long after Duterte leaves the political stage, seem to take after him, in rhetoric if not in deed. With political chutzpah and self-righteousness, they recast all sorts of actors—Duterte’s predecessors, the communists, critics, anti-vaxxers, rich economies—as stupes and bullies and villains out to foil their best-laid plans. Criticisms are taken and chewed out as vehement spins and infantile tantrums. Then, always on the defensive, they would refuse to level with the public and rather report out and dwell only on drop-in-the-bucket accomplishments.\nSure, we cannot expect the government to cite, say, the pandemic response index released by Lowly Institute, a Sydney-based think-tank, that ranked the Philippines as 79th out of 98 countries evaluated using indicators such as COVID-19 deaths and confirmed cases as a proportion of tests. Losers, though self-aware, rarely admit they choked. It pays to be honest, though, to own up to the blunders made and to reckon with their far graver implications down the line should they remain unaddressed.\nMatters of policy and life and death do not afford us the luxury and hollow spectacle of self-preening speeches. While Duterte has once described the country’s vaccination program as sluggish and fitful, this is not an admission of culpability so much as pointing out the obvious. His anodyne assurances and trollish threats can only do so much.\nSo far, as of writing, only around 1.46 million doses from China’s Sinovac and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca have been given and still failed to cover the 1.7 million health care workers who are on top of the priority list and whom Galvez said would have been inoculated by the end of the first quarter. The limited doses barely deterred several government officials from jumping the line—a clear violation of the terms of the COVAX program, according to WHO Philippines representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, that could force the facility to withhold from the country millions of free shots in the pipeline.\nBy contrast, the vaccine rollout in Myanmar, still in the throes of a military coup, has even fared more swimmingly, with about two per 100 people having received at least one dose of the jab. There is nowhere to go but up, so the platitude goes. But we cannot underestimate the Duterte administration’s willingness to imperil the wellbeing of thousands, the breadth of its recklessness and indifference, its capacity to set us back even farther and to plunge the country deeper into an economic slump.\nDuterte, captive of his own cockeyed politics, has still over a full year to either redeem or reprise what has so far been a malign and unavailing pandemic performance. Our expectations could go much lower at every turn. His latest slip in a speech on April 19 hardly inspires trust. At one point he asked everyone in the room what else was on the agenda. Someone coached him. “Ah, itong COVID? Oh, well,” he said. A leader who regards as an afterthought a pandemic that continues to convulse communities and customs offers no salvation. It is every vulnerable life and embattled institution that needs saving from him.\nOriginally published in the Philippine Collegian.\n ","categories":"","description":"The Duterte administration has had to navigate bureaucratic mazes of its own making and, along the way, failed to leap on vaccine deals that could have gotten the country to the front of the queue.","excerpt":"The Duterte administration has had to navigate bureaucratic mazes of …","ref":"/news/philippine-bureaucrats-botched-the-covid-19-vaccine-program/","tags":"","title":"Philippine bureaucrats botched the COVID-19 vaccine program, with denials and deflection"},{"body":" Taft Community Pantry: Magbigay ayon sa kakayahan. Kumuha batay sa pangangailangan. (Manila Today)\n   “There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope.” –Bernard Williams\n Death, Disease, hunger, bankruptcy, face masks, face shield, ICU. All these words have barged into our daily vocabulary like a thief in the night.\nThe global devastation brought about by COVID-19 has left us all in a zombie-like-state-worthy of a Stephen King novel. And just like the state of the world, our country is reeling, faltering from the severe effects of the global pandemic which has claimed the lives of over 3,000,000 people around the world.\nThe darkness of uncertainty looms over us like a lion ready to devour its prey. We are all afraid. Governments and scientists alike have poured everything they have into developing a cure, a vaccine, medication.\nSome through desperation have tried alternative drugs to help combat the spread, but what is the real virus, is it the coronavirus? Or is it fear?\nWhatever your opinion maybe, the fear is real.\nYet, from a small street aptly named Maginhawa seems to be making a real dent in the war against the deadly virus and its effects. Yes, the Filipino spirit is at it again, there is something about the blood of this culture that is stubborn, hard-headed and would not seem to back down when their backs are against the wall.\nA new buzzword has invaded our mouths, this time as a real glimmer of hope.\nThe community pantry, an old table on top of it are daily necessities for anyone to take and give freely. This revolution has spread faster than any corona variant can, tables and food of all kinds given by the needy, taken by the needy.\nNo frills, no lights no cameras, no announcements, no midnight speeches, nothing but pure unadulterated caring. From one human being to the next. This is a whole new People power movement to topple the status quo of hunger, unemployment and brutal loss that has hounded us for more than a year. Even when government raises its hands in defeat, the Filipino spirit will not lay down and die. The simple act of kindness is in reality a massive act of defiance screaming, NO, we will not be defeated, whatever you may bring, we will look after each other no matter what.\nThe community pantry movement has faced criticisms, stemming from forces that are supposed to be bound by duty to serve we, the people. But like in every bunch, there will always be a few bad apples, but those bad apples will soon realize that they are in an orchard of selflessness. Whether it influences them or not, only time may tell.\nDespite the positive movement, labels have been surfacing such as communists, rebels, and others too shallow to even discuss. But I, as a simple citizen challenge you, no matter the threat, no matter the label, no matter the propaganda given by our so-called leaders, we should be the change that the world will see.\nThis uprising has given us many inspirational stories, such as Ana Patricia Non, who at 26 years old has probably seen a steep rise in hunger, desperation and hopelessness. She is the initiator of the first Community pantry. Bravo to her, don’t backdown from the evil that persecutes you Ma’am, we are with you. Then there is Alberto Calanza, 52 a chicharron and balut vendor, who despite his limited income still found it in his heart to donate three packs of noodles. In addition to this, there is also Manong Romeo who one day, passed the community pantry in their district only to find it closed; instead of asking for goods, he gave 46 pesos in small change as a donation from selling metal scrap. Countless stories are sprouting on social media about regular folks making a difference in the country.\nAll the stories, smiles and joyful tears coming from this movement, kind of reminds me of something that happened long ago when a rebel received 5 loaves and 2 fish and the multitude was fed.\nAs of today, the Maginhawa community pantry has sprouted into hundreds of locations feeding many of our countrymen. Not only that, it has even influenced other countries such as Timor-Leste who have put up their own community pantry to relieve their citizens from the effects of devastating floods. We are setting an example to those who have abandoned us in the midst of this pandemic, we don’t need the empty promises, worthless initiatives and now even the childish name calling, the Filipino will always look out for each other.\nWhile the dreaded virus is still upon us, absolute precautions should still be observed, and most importantly we should realize and recognize that there are heroes in each of us that can ease the burden that this pandemic has brought. Who would have thought a simple act of kindness could spread like a wild fire as hope takes centerstage after the spotlight has been on despair for quite a while?\nThe Philippines still shows the world of its unmatchable heart, unconditional caring and soon, we will change what the perspective of the world was, from the sick man of Asia to the hope of the world.\nOriginally published in Manila Today.\n ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Taft Community Pantry: Magbigay ayon sa kakayahan.

(Nicolas Antonio / Philippine Collegian)\n  It began in an outdoor tent of all places. I remember being a wide-eyed kid in the fifth grade browsing awkwardly through the titles on display at the Scholastic book fair that seemed to have magically popped up at my school one morning. Because I did not have money then, the salesclerk gave me a piece of paper bearing the header “wish list” where I should, she said, write down the books I wanted and their corresponding prices so that I could show them to my parents later on. And so I did.\nFor a 10-year-old kid who never really had an experience with handling money, as my mom insisted on sending me to school with snacks instead of an allowance all throughout elementary, a couple of hundred pesos seemed like the world. I went to school the next day with a clear vision: I was going home with a new book that day. Thus began a lifelong affliction.\nIn the words I found worlds. Pretty cliché, I know. But I suppose this is a collective memory for us awkward adolescents who tried to escape the schoolyard drama by wallowing in the pages of fiction. Who among us did not fantasize about receiving a Hogwarts letter or suddenly waking up to a post-apocalyptic universe? Weird as these thoughts may be now, but growing up, books offered some semblance of comfort in the prospect of other worlds so different from this one.\nI carried this relationship with the written word well into high school. I used to save up a portion of my allowance for my weekly mall trips, where, by default, the first stop would either be National Book Store—back when it was more books and less store—or Booksale, with its allure of cheaper second-hand titles stacked somewhat haphazardly all over the place.\nNaturally, our high school’s library became a sort of sacred spot for me, part refuge, part place for adventure. It was extremely small and cramped, but it was, in a way, the biggest part of the school with all the worlds it contained. I spent so much time there that the librarian found it fitting to leave me its keys at times, making me something sort of an unofficial school librarian (which came in handy whenever I needed to use the library printer for the schoolwork I so often crammed).\nBut when I entered UP and became inducted to its long tradition of malicious overthinking, even the act of reading and buying books became an area for problematization. I remember my freshman English professor expressing her disdain for copyright and outright advocating for the piracy of texts. That she was an accomplished writer who wanted people to pirate even her works seemed strange to me at the time, a sort of discordant position I could not readily reconcile in my mind.\nIn a Filipino class, I distinctly recall a heated discussion on why Filipinos consistently rank among the lowest in global reading comprehension surveys—a reality made so painfully clear by a 2020 DepEd report detailing how a staggering 70,000 elementary students in the Bicol region alone cannot even read. What does it mean to be a reader in a country where a sizable chunk of the population remains illiterate, impoverished, and probably starving, too?\nFor the longest time, my ever-growing pile of books, now numbering in the hundreds but some remaining unread even after years since purchase, has been a source of both pride and guilt. There is, as Edgar Calabia Samar so beautifully put it, an everyday sadness in knowing one is not reading enough. But the stack of unread books also serves, as Umberto Eco first pointed out, as a tangible reminder of how much we still do not know—an instant source of intellectual humility that runs counter to the predilection to complacency we in the educated class tend to fall into the trappings of.\nMore recently, a mix of middle-class guilt and the steady socio-political conscientization I got from the university both inside and outside the classroom made me look at my book collection in a different, more critical light. The image of Smaug from Tolkien’s The Hobbit came to mind, the greedy dragon who sits lazily atop his massive pile of wealth while proudly declaring that he will not part with a single piece despite not having any immediate use for the treasure.\nBut I know the burden of democratizing knowledge lays not in those who have hoarded piles of the written work. How many other children would have been bookworms had their parents earned enough money to send a couple of hundred pesos with them to the next book fair that pops up? Or simply had access to a functioning school library. To borrow words from the poet Conchitina Cruz, the aforementioned English teacher: “It is more crucial to foreground the inherently restrictive role of material conditions in the activity of reading any kind of literature. The ordinary Filipino cannot afford to be a reader.”\nThese days when Zoom calls force us to share a snapshot of our domestic situations, bookcases seem to have become a popular video call background, owing, perhaps, to the fact that book ownership is an acceptable way to signal one’s capital, whether cultural or otherwise. Truth be told, it takes an extraordinary amount of privilege to be able to not just afford books but actually have the time to read them in this society that values a myopic view of productivity over leisure, profit over welfare.\nThe challenge for the educated class, then, is to find ways to use our talents and skills—the cultural capital we accrued from having free time, thanks to the labor of others—to democratize the society that allows for both book-hoarding and illiteracy simultaneously. Doing so necessitates a more equitable distribution of wealth, there is no other way around it. Books are meant to be read, and our books deserve more readers.\nOriginally published in the Philippine Collegian.\n ","categories":"","description":"For the longest time, my ever-growing pile of books, now numbering in the hundreds but some remaining unread years since purchase, has been a source of both pride and guilt.","excerpt":"For the longest time, my ever-growing pile of books, now numbering in …","ref":"/news/ode-to-my-ever-growing-pile-of-unread-books-%E3%82%B3%E3%83%94%E3%83%BC/","tags":"","title":"Ode to my ever-growing pile of unread books"},{"body":" \rAAp/AP/Kaname Yoneyama\r\rAs tensions with China continue to grow, Japan is making moves to join the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance. This week, Japan’s ambassador to Australia, Shingo Yamagami, told The Sydney Morning Herald he was “optimistic” about his country coming on board. \r[I] would like to see this idea become reality in the near future.\n\rThis comes as New Zealand voices its concerns over using the Five Eyes process to pressure China. What is this spy alliance? And what are the benefits and risks to bringing Japan on board? What is the Five Eyes?\rBeginning as an intelligence exchange agreement between the United States and United Kingdom in 1943, it formally became the UKUSA Agreement in 1946. The agreement then extended to Canada in 1948, and Australia and New Zealand in 1956. This long-running collaboration has been particularly useful for sharing signals intelligence, or intelligence gathered from communications and information systems. The group’s focus has shifted over time, from targeting the USSR during the Cold War, to Islamist terrorism after the September 11 attacks in 2001, to the rising challenge from China today.\nJapan’s intelligence infrastructure\rThere is a significant intelligence tradition in Japan. After the Meiji Restoration of the 19th century, the imperial Japanese army and navy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs developed extensive intelligence networks. These aided the rise of the Japanese empire in its wars against China, Russia and eventually the Western allies in the second world war. After the war, Japan’s intelligence services were revamped under American supervision. Japan has since been an important base of operations for US intelligence operations in Asia, particularly by military intelligence, the CIA and the National Security Agency.\n\rThe Japanese intelligence community now comprises a range of services, including the Ministry of Defense’s Directorate for Signals Intelligence, which provides expertise in regional signals intelligence. Given Japan’s proximity to China, North Korea, and Russia, Japan may well be an attractive addition to the Five Eyes alliance. There is also a precedence for formal intelligence sharing with the West. As well as its long-running collaboration with the US, an Information Security Agreement was signed between Australia and Japan in 2012. At the end of 2016, the US, Japan and Australia signed a similar trilateral agreement deepening the extent of covert security cooperation.\nJapan’s close relationship to the US is seen in Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s visit last week to the US, the first foreign leader to be officially hosted by President Joe Biden. The talks in Washington focused heavily on China. Previous reluctance to expand the group\rWhile the Five Eyes group has often cooperated with the intelligence services of Japan on an ad hoc basis — as well as those of France, Germany and Israel — there has so far been reluctance among the Five Eyes members to formally broaden the alliance. The US especially has had doubts in the past about the security and reliability of the Japanese intelligence community. In particular, this is due to concerns over its relative lack of overseas experience.\n\rSuga was the first foreign leader to be hosted formally by President Joe Biden.\rAAP/AP\r\r\rIn 2013, the Abe government passed a controversial Designated State Secrets Law to reduce these vulnerabilities and present Japan as a more valuable security partner. The ensuing revamp of the intelligence services, under firmer central direction of a National Security Council, has reformed Japan’s capabilities to some extent.\nBut further complicating matters, New Zealand has now shown its hesitancy about using Five Eyes to pressure China. This threatens to undermine the unity and stability of the alliance, even raising the prospect of New Zealand leaving Five Eyes altogether.\nWhat about China?\rJapan’s relationship with China — its neighbour and main trading partner — could potentially be a stumbling block. This relationship was managed fairly successfully under the Abe government, where the mutual benefits of trade and investment were prioritised. This has largely continued under Suga, but more hawkish members of the government are starting to push a tougher line against China. \r\r\r\rRead more:\rQuad group makes vaccine deal as a wary China watches on\r\r\r\rWith the ongoing territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands, and more assertive demonstrations of force by the People’s Liberation Army, relations between China and Japan have become much frostier. As Japan is on the “frontline” with China, becoming a Five Eyes member has the potential to improve its strategic position via stronger support from its alliance partners. Leadership change in Japan?\rThe best prospect for Japan joining Five Eyes probably lies with cabinet minister Taro Kono. He is the minister for administrative reform, responsible for supervising Japan’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout. In his previous tenure as defence minister, Kono was enthusiastically in favour of Japan joining Five Eyes. The energetic, media-savvy and ambitious Kono is widely favoured to replace Suga as prime minister if he does not survive a vote for leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in September. An election for the lower house of the Diet (Japan’s parliament) also must be held by October. Security environment could make the decision\rA more threatening security environment overall may hasten the push towards a “Six Eyes” anyway. A cyber attack on the Australian parliament in 2019 was implicitly blamed on China, while the US counterintelligence establishment is still reeling from the consequences of the massive Russian SolarWinds cyber attack and Moscow’s interference in the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections.\n\r\r\r\rRead more:\rJapan is facing a fourth COVID wave and sluggish vaccine rollout. Will it be ready for the Olympics?\r\r\r\rThis week, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police have blamed the People’s Liberation Army for organising hundreds of cyber attacks on Japanese companies, universities and government departments, including Japan’s space agency JAXA. This is certain to harden opinion against China.\nIf all members agree, especially with encouragement from the US, it would be fairly straightforward for Japan to formally join the Five Eyes. If the regional security environment continues to deteriorate, the declaration of a Six Eyes alliance incorporating Japan would be a clear diplomatic signal of a determination to confront China in intelligence and espionage.Craig Mark, Professor, Faculty of International Studies, Kyoritsu Women's University\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Japan’s push to join the West’s intelligence alliance"},{"body":" Susana Heights, SLEX checkpoint (Photo by Rappler)\n  Flaunting an inconsistent mouthpiece of Malacañang Palace, Harry Roque seems to have really adapted the absurd habit of his master: slipping his tongue and taking it back after a while as he said that the Philippines has been on a prolonged vacation due to the coronavirus pandemic. For that, the government then found a way to revoke this so-called ‘vacation’ and to reopen our lost economy –reclassify three holidays as special working holidays, which is totally unsympathetic to every Filipino laborer.\nSo the truth reveals, the administration only sees this whole pandemic, the series of imposed community quarantines, the loss of jobs of over a million workers, the deaths of numerous businesses, the sufferings of each household figuring how they could eat their next meals and such, as a mere vacation! It must be the reason why they do not do their services with due diligence rather than just ‘gross incompetence’ (as Senator Sotto described), to render for the Filipino people. Yet, our laborers never rested nor even have their peace of mind; they have lost their opportunities to earn a living.\nThis conflict in labor and employment has undoubtedly struck the Philippine economy. And now that the state of work and service are slowly going back, although still far from normal, Duterte, under Proclamation 1107 amended the list of holidays and special days for 2021 declaring November 2, December 24 and 31 as special working holidays to encourage economic productivity and minimize work disruption to recover from the adverse impact of the pandemic. As if the continuity of work is the issue, these special working holidays will just be ordinary working days but with commemoration –meaning they will no longer have an additional pay equal to the 30% of their daily basic wage.\nComing from positions of power, influence, and wealth, this is a huge insult to Filipino workers doing more than they should to provide for their families and keep themselves surviving during this pandemic that the current government is monumentally failing to address properly. They force Filipinos to perceive the struggle we face as a battle between economy and health when so many other countries in the world have managed to balance both aspects by implementing scientific solutions provided by the right and competent people.\nThis reflects how Duterte and his government managed the pandemic overall: through surface-level interventions that does not help the country in the long term, provide more suffering to ordinary workers, and to boast as if this is a solution that will benefit the country. Reasoning that it can stimulate the economy if work proceeds as usual during holidays, they seemed to have forgotten that an economy cannot fully function if the citizens and the workers have no money to spend. So, unsurprisingly, this move seems to favor the rich businessmen and employers who have more than enough to make it through this pandemic and even extravagantly celebrate the holidays while workers toil their duties, act as if it was a normal day, and to return home with improper compensation.\nNot only the compensation is the case but also the chance of our workers to return from their home provinces during long holidays, as reasoned by Leni Robredo in her radio show. They barely have enough rest as they get a hold of their overwhelming workloads and the new normal set-up in workplaces, and celebrating those special occasions together with the family is what some workers are used to earning their relaxation. Taking it from them, does the government think of nothing? Aren’t they the ones who were unproductive in finding measures?\nThese holidays are also beneficial for overall mental health and peace of minds of Filipinos. In an environment as stressful as virtual work or physical work with extra rules imposed, breaks are badly needed. In fact, breaks and work pauses are proven to be helpful in increasing productivity and a healthy working mind. Why should the government limit this from a worker? It is pointless and abusive towards the people who choose to spend their holidays with their families and with themselves.\nWhile countries like the United States, British Columbia, France, Virginia and others are raising their efforts for achieving a hundred percent mass vaccination, Duterte unbelievably had this insane proclamation signifying how much of a bully his administration is. It is their desperate act of not being able to think of a decent solution that the workers who have endured long enough are those who they insensitively let to torment more.\nThis is evident with how much Roque blames the public for the increase in COVID-19 cases because of not following the minimum public health protocols while also encouraging everyone to go out and spend and jumpstart the economy. Excusing their constant inconsistency, they are becoming hypocrites who will not, under any circumstances, admit their wrongs in implementing much more relevant rules that can actually help the country. While the public may not be 100% innocent in this case, it is still the government, who constantly changes the rules, increasingly loosening health policies, and then blames the public for surges in cases.\nNow that they pretend to care about public health again because of the rise in cases, it is workers again who must suffer. For months, last year, they failed to implement a viable solution of balancing public health and preventing economic collapse despite their constant reassurances that the best and brightest in the government are working to find a solution. Now the burden falls again on workers to try to adjust and think of ways on how to survive.\nFilipino workers have been greatly affected by this global health crisis. The reduction of special non-working holidays are not just a loss of their ‘supposedly additional pay’, but also of their actual rest with their families. The government boasts of their excellence in handling the pandemic yet they constantly fail to help those affected and their self-proclaimed achievements are yet to be felt by the citizens. If they have nothing to offer in boosting the economy apart from this, then they, who the incompetent and unproductive ones are, must resign and take a vacation away from national affairs that they cannot do right.\nOriginally published in The Catalyst.\n ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Susana Heights, SLEX checkpoint (Photo by Rappler)\n  Flaunting an …","ref":"/news/dutertes-poor-measures-worsen-at-critical-time/","tags":"","title":"Duterte’s poor measures worsen at critical time"},{"body":" (Graphic by Manila Today)\n  There was a time when the heroes people revered were nobodies. By nobody I mean one with no special or privileged status in society. Judging by the social standards of their (and our time) they were considered failures. Their conditions were often in the worse; they were familiar with all sorts of discomfort. They were masters of a certain tragedy of one kind or another.\nThink of Jesus, a lowly carpenter in the poorest colony of the Roman Empire, who ended up on the cross. Socrates, a professional idler, ugly and pot-bellied, was forced to drink the hemlock. Diogenes, a cynic philosopher, lived in a wooden tub, and was not much impressed by Alexander The Great. The great Marxist philosopher and organizer Antonio Gramsci languished in jail. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X were assassinated by their fellow Afro-Americans. Many of the greatest poets and writers of the early 20th century were wiped out through purges and persecutions.\nThe Filipino national hero and martyr Jose Rizal did not earn a single centime from his two great books; and his short-lived profession as an ophthalmologist did not bring much profits because as he said most of his clients were “very poor.”\nOn account of their being a nobody, they were profound students and teachers of life. They were possessed by a seething spirit of grace to which the world owes marvelous acts of compassion, goodness, beauty, intelligence and imagination. Moving and poignant the lives they had led this old school class of heroes has today become quite unfashionable, untrendy; the values and causes they had embraced seem to violate our present culture’s extreme individualism and our learned obsession with comfort. They seem to us extreme to the extent that if they were alive today their presence would seem to kill the party.\nToday the people we consider as heroes are nothing of the sort. They are the well-dressed billionaires, CEOs, Silicon Valley technocrats and the countless social media influencers who give us an endless stream of banality and ostentation. They would rather not be called a “teacher” for the word is far too mundane and an affectionate diminutive of the term minimum wage. So they prefer to be acclaimed as “life coach,” motivational speaker,” “guru,” “expert.” Unlike the heroes of the old school who were often deprived of banquets the heroes of the social media age are the familiar house guests of prestigious universities and schools, TV shows, podcasts, online talks (TED Talks), etc. They give countless speeches and interviews although they have nothing worthwhile to say. The young generations fall at their feet.\nBecause they bring the good news. You too can be successful; you too can be a billionaire; you too can be famous; you too can stand out from the rest of the unmotivated average lot. Their philosophy is not that difficult to follow because it’s all about the “me.” Their method can be summed up as follows: “10 steps to winning,” 12 rules of success,” “bring out the power of the inner you,” “the secret of greatness,” “how to stay hard,”… and so many other variation of this nonsense which I’m sure you’re familiar with.\nIn today’s culture, alongside heroism success is equated with genius. Status equals wisdom. A Tesla car is presented to the public with a touch of scientific enthusiasm comparable to the discovery of the theory of relativity and quantum physics. Elon Musk, whose inventions are nothing more than toys for the very rich, dreams of colonizing the universe. Any semi-educated person who has read a little of history will feel dread and disgust at the thought. As you (I assume) and I know, wherever we humans go we leave an endless trail of blood and destruction.\nIt is quite ironic that Musk’s company was named after a great scientist and inventor, Nikola Tesla whose inventions and developments influenced much of modern life (unlike Musk’s toys for the rich), dreamed of energy free for all and never amassed millions on the contrary died poor and abandoned by society.\nSteve Jobs’ posthumous fame turned him into a saint and genius. Except that his genius required the collaboration of his brilliant assistants and the over-romanticization of his biographer and his saintliness did not count the sweatshop factories where the excessively overworked Chinese laborers (12 hours/day, 30 days per month) earn approximately 10.13 yuan/hour, or roughly $1.62 per hour, less than half the recommended living wage of about 3.77 per hour. And saint Jobs didn’t give much thought whether the discarded computer parts of his genius invention ended up in our already too polluted oceans.\nBill Gates, the most loved nerd in the history of nerdom, friend and competitor of and as equally super rich as saint Jobs, has become hugely influential for his insistently annoying climate change sermons. The ubiquitous all-round expert has even written a pretentious little book entitled, How To Avoid A Climate Disaster; such a moving rhetorical, evangelical advice from one of the third richest person in the world, who owns more private farmland than anyone else in the US, an avid collector of private jets and Porsche cars, living in a mansion large enough to house the climate refuges in the world. So he kindly preaches us average human beings to eat synthetic beef if we want to avoid an environmental catastrophe.\nJeff Bezos, the king of the Amazon, also the king of tax evasion, who generously donates millions of dollars to government organizations but refuses to raise the minimum wage of his workers and threatens them if they attempt to join a union. But the king is generous enough to gift his subjects with surveillance bracelets just in case they become too indulgent and lazy. As to the social media influencers who are self-appointed experts on everything, I rest my case.\nThese personalities appeal to our present culture because they uphold the cult of success and winning. In a culture that abhors the failure, the simple, the quiet, and the loser, these billionaires are refashioned as heroes. If you don’t stand out, it’s your own fault, or you don’t work enough or you’re not motivated enough. No wonder they place value on the rags-to-riches and the pursuit of happiness story. Instead of demanding social and economic justice for communities they prefer to romanticize the individual’s hero’s journey. They appeal to the misguided young because they offer that image of power specially if the young were those who grew up in an economically-disadvantaged countries. Amassing billions may appear a worthy enterprise, a heroic feat to one who is constantly in financial struggle. But to arrive to such a position of wealth and power requires a great dose of indifference, apathy, cruelty, rapaciousness, and narcissism. The truth is the rich heroes of today have nothing of value to say. They are illiterate of genuine culture. They are detached from the everyday realities of average people like you and me. Their speeches may sound full of concern for humanity—yes, for as long as their wealth and privileges remain untouched.\n Carlo Rey Lacsamana is a Filipino born and raised in Manila, Philippines.

Lagi lang kasi namin kayong nakikita na pasilip-silip sa kalangitan, tapos sabi’y 2012 sasakupin niyo kami pero 2021 na wala pa rin kayo. Mahal ba ang pamasahe mula sa inyo papunta rito sa’min?\nNakakapagod na rin kasi ang siklo ng buhay rito. May isang matandang lalaking pa-shy type na ayaw kuno tumakbo pero kalauna’y napilit din. Mga panahon iyon bago dumating ang sakuna. Heto kami ngayon, tulala, litong-lito habang binabasa ang mga katagang nakatanggap umano ng 91% approval rating ang matandang lalaki.\nLubha nga namang napakataas nito gayong sa higit ilang pangakong inilatag niya’y bilang lamang sa daliri ang masasabing tunay niyang nagawa.

Bakit ka matatakot kung paulit-ulit ka na niyang dinudusta? “Eh siyempre binabangasan niyo siya, kaya pupuntiryahin ka talaga!”\nHep, hep. Mali, tinutuligsa niya ang mga ito dahil hindi lang naman sila grupo ng mga “bumabatikos” sa kanya, hello, siyempre natatakot siya na mas lumalaki ang bilang ng mga Pilipinong nakikisangkot sa pagkilos, kapag mas maraming namumulat, mas uunti ang bilang ng mga mapaglalaruan niya sa kanyang daliri. In short, takot siya sa pananagutan, ganern!\nTiyaka, ano na bang bago sa kanya? Lagi naman niyang idinadaan sa mura at payabang, kulang naman sa gawa! Lagi pang mainit ang ulo lalong-lalo na kay Kumareng Leni na niraratsada niya palagi ng mga maling akusasyon at misodyinistikong komento. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.

Tiyaka simula 2016 pa lang naman ay tinuring na silang ‘propaganda tool’ ng ilang mga maka-anti-Duterte lalo pa’t sa kabila ng mga isyung kinahaharap na ng matanda’y parang pinapabango nga nito ang imahe nito sa madla.\nTapos itong pandemya pa na pinalusog ang dependensya ng mga Pilipino sa pulitiko. Ipinapakita lang nito na dahil dito, nakokontrol nila ang mga tao. Patuloy niyang inaabuso ang pagkakataon na ito upang makapagpalakas at makaani ng katanyagan at suporta sa masa.\nIdagdag mo pa itong paglabas nila ng mga napipisil na tumakbo para sa eleksyon sa 2022 kung saan nangunguna sa listahan ang anak ng matandang lalaki na si Sara, hindi ang munting prinsesang nagbabalat ng patatas, kung hindi si Sara, with no H, Duterte. Hindi ko na talaga alam.\nAyun, maghihintay ako sa tugon ninyo. Sana huwag ninyong i-snob.

Sa kabilang dako, nariyan naman ang kanyang munting prinsesang si Sara na nangunguna sa mga napipisil na tumakbo para sa eleksyon sa taong 2022. Marahil kalakip nang pagpapabango ng imahe ni Duterte ay ang siya namang pagyakap nila sa sabihin na nating ibang telang hinabi sa parehong hiblang si Sara.\nMahuhumaling sa kanya ang mga tao, isang bagay na kritikal kung ikokonsidera natin ang sitwasyon sa bansa, na karaniwang nadadala ang tao sa bigat ng kanilang pangalan kaysa sa kanilang demokratikong paniniwala. Nawawala ang konsensya’t maging ang ipinatong na pananagutan dahil nadadala ang lahat sa numerong ipinapakita ng mga sarbey na ito na kung ‘di mapag-aaralan ay mas lalong magiging daan upang maipalaganap ang huwad na katotohanan.\nDahil dito, isa lamang ang maaaring makita, dahil sa kawalan ng pang-unawa, sa mga nababasang iisang mukha lang ang nakikita, hindi maipagkakaila na magiging ‘self-fulfilling’ ang mga sarbey na ito, “it rightly or wrongly spawns subliminal bias.”\nSa inilabas na ulat ng Pulse Asia, ba’t hindi nila inilatag ang bilang ng mga tumanggi na lumahok o kaya’y mga katanungang hindi nasagot? Sa paraang ito ay maaaring magkaroon ng ideya ang publiko kung lubos bang naapektuhan ng takot o posisyon nila sa pulitika ang lumabas na resulta. Maaari rin namang nakahimlay ito sa mga ibinatong katanungan lalo pa’t balita ko’y ang pinagbasehan lamang na ‘performance’ niya’y mula Hunyo hanggang Agosto, masyadong makipot para mapisil ang katas na hinahanap ng karamihan.\nAng ganitong uri ng mga pangyayari’y hamon sa bawat isa na hindi lang dapat magpadala sa kung anong numero ang inihahapag sa mesa.

Isang patunay kung bakit ang matematika’y esensyal ‘pagkat hindi lamang ito sa numero bumabatay kung ‘di pati na rin sa pag-unawa sa mga lumalabas na resulta.\nKung magpapatuloy na maninindigan ang Pulse Asia sa 91% trust rating at approval rating ni Duterte, parang ginagawa na lamang nito ang kanyang sarili bilang mekaniko ng isang bulok na sistema. Sinesegunduhan ang mga mamamayan ng isang maling uri ng pagtitiwala.\nNgayon, hahayaan niyo na lang bang diktahan ng 1,200 respondente ang kapalaran ng milyong Pilipino? Hindi. Dapat sila’y managot.\nMagiging mabunga lamang ang resulta ng mga ito kung sasagutin lamang ito ng tapat. Subalit, sa kasalukuyang kalagayan ng bansa, maaaring karamihan sa mga ito’y resulta lamang buhat ng takot o kohersyon kaysa sa kung ano ang nararapat.\nHindi dapat gamitin na rason ang resulta na ito upang maabswelto sila sa pananagutan hinggil sa lumalalang kalagayan ng karapatang pantao, korapsyon, at ang nababansot na kalagayang pangkalusugan ng bansa. Hindi dapat mabulag sa ‘high trust rating’ bagkus gamitin ang kakayahan na bumoto sa eleksyon sa taong 2022 para hatulan ang kanilang kapalaran.\nSubalit masidhi na ang paghihirap at lantarang paglabag sa karapatan ng masa, hihintayin pa ba ninyo ang isa pang taon para makaalpas dito?\nHindi na dapat isaalang-alang ang buhay ng mga mamamayang uhaw na sa katiwasayan. Gamitin ito upang makapagpakilos at mangmulat ng mga indibidwal na niligaw ng kanilang paghanga. Talaga namang parang mala-Fangirl ang peg dito, si Paulo si Papa niyo Digz at si Jane ang die-hard fans nito.\nDesperado na ang matandang lalaki sa katanyagan lalo pa’t kailangan nitong magpalawig ng kanyang galamay. Subalit ang desperasyon na ito’y hindi mag-uugat ng pagtitiwala kung ‘di mag-uugat lamang ng pagnipis ng pag-asang inaasam ng lahat.\nHigit sa lahat, huwag sisihin ang mga biktima ng pang-aalipusta, huwag sisihin na kaya may mali kasi pinipilit ng tao na may mali. Kung maninindigan ka rito, parang ipinakita mo na rin na ika’y hinuhulma mula sa isang hiblang dugo ang bunga.\nOkay na kaming makita sa KMJS o Rated K na pasilip-silip lang sa heaven.

What we could not have known then was that April 7 was the point at which the peak, or at least the first peak, in mortality in England and Wales was reached. Analysis from the Financial Times, which includes deaths outside hospitals, has posited April 8 as the peak for COVID-19 deaths for the whole of the UK.\nHere, those April 7 graphs are updated for Europe and geographical evidence is drawn together from around the rest of the world to try to paint a clearer picture of the direction in which we are heading – probably one where countries converge towards a single global death rate.\nEngland and Wales reach a peak\rFirst, the situation in England and Wales. The graph below shows the rise in mortality each day since the outbreak began, not just in hospitals, until April 9. The additional data is provided by the Office for National Statistics in its weekly reports.\nThis graph and the one below are based on smoothed data, which uses a moving average for the period from the day before to the day after each date shown to better illustrate a trend.\n\r\rMortality in England and Wales attributed to COVID-19, March 6 to April 9 2020.\rDanny Dorling, Author provided\r\r\rThe peak by this method of counting occurred on April 7 when the smoothed number of deaths recorded was 1,001, compared to 944 on April 6 were 879 on April 8. Rates of change in affected countries\rThe graph above is conventional. The one below is a bit different. It shows both the smoothed number of deaths each day but now also the rate of change in that number. And it adds data from seven additional country datasets: France, the USA, Spain, Italy, China, Germany and the UK as a whole. These seven countries are highlighted because they originally had the highest number of deaths. The data is more up to date in this graph because it is mostly drawn from the most recent daily hospital data.\n\r\rMortality in seven countries attributed to COVID-19 (January 23 to April 20, 2020)\rDanny Dorling, Author provided\r\r\rThe method of showing change used in the graph above was developed for my book, Slowdown, which I worked on with illustrator Kirsten McClure who turned my crude Excel graphs into the clearer visual shown above. It’s a useful way to look at data when you are trying to demonstrate change over time. When a line curves to the right, deaths per day are increasing. When it curves to the left, they are decreasing. Loops indicate a change in trend – so death rates rising, falling and rising again.\nThis graph shows the rise in mortality in seven countries up until April 20. By this point, the daily number of deaths was falling most days in most countries, although it had risen to be very high in the US. Most intriguing is that from April 7 to 10, the shape of the curve for England and Wales, when all absolutely certain COVID-19 related deaths including in care homes are included, almost exactly matches that for France. This is significant because there is so much debate about how different European countries are doing, when in fact it is the similarities that are most remarkable.\nIn all the countries shown here, the fall in deaths may have begun a little earlier than the imposition of lockdowns would have suggested, although the lockdowns almost certainly accelerated the falls. The looping effect was seen originally in China, and may suggest one outbreak superimposed upon another.\nThe rest of the world\rThe final graph shows the current fatality rates of all those known to have the virus in the 21 countries that had conducted 10,000 tests by April 22, excluding the seven above. \r\rMortality in 21 countries attributed to COVID-19 of those testing positive for the disease by April 22, 2020.\rDanny Dorling, Author provided\r\r\rIt ranges from Singapore, where only one in 1,000 of all those who have tested positive have died, to Belgium, where 15% or almost one in seven have died. In Belgium, it is almost exclusively people who are very ill who are tested and so the mortality rate appears to be 150 times higher than in Singapore where a much wider range of the public has been tested. But the real mortality rate of these two countries will end up being very similar, and much nearer to the lower end of the range. It is extremely unlikely that Singapore, with its very efficient health system, is failing to record the deaths of those known to have the disease.\nThis illustrates a key point: over time, all of these mortality rates will probably begin to converge on a single global rate of those who have caught the disease. This is what has happened in the past. The flu of 1918 may have had a mortality rate as high as 2% of all those who caught it. In contrast, the H1N1 flu of 2009 had a mortality rate 100 times lower at 0.02%. For COVID-19, the final rate will tend to be towards the lower end of the spectrum shown, if this disease is at all like previous pandemics, which we don’t know for sure yet. The picture is complex. But these graphs tell us a few key things: England and Wales passed at least one peak on April 7. And, based on the second graph, it’s clear that rates have begun to cascade down in Europe. Across the globe, rates vary widely based on differing testing policies – but we can expect that they will converge around a single figure before too long.\n\r\r\rGet the latest news and analysis, direct from the experts in your inbox, every day.

Wuhan, a city of over 11 million people, has been placed in a lockdown, borders have been closed, and a number of governments have instituted selective travel restrictions and prohibitions based on citizenship and legal status—including suspending visas to anyone with a Chinese passport.\nNCoV—since renamed as COVID19—is a serious health issue, particularly for those already suffering from chronic and respiratory diseases. The effectiveness of quarantines, however, is doubtful, raising the question of what value there is to quarantines if it’s not public health.\nThere is political value in the quarantine for those who implicitly believe biological-racial purity is a condition of health, but there is also financial value in substituting a social approach to health and illness with a selective, nationalist model conducive to the development of patented treatments and private health insurance.\nFor some, the quarantine rationalizes xenophobia and calls for ethnonationalist separation. The United States government has imposed a travel ban—or, more accurately, significantly expanded its obsession with restricting the movements of nonwhite people. Drawing on a long history of anti-Chinese sentiment, the Australian government has prohibited the entry of noncitizens from China and proposed to transport Australian citizens—many of whom will have traveled to China to celebrate the New Year with relatives—directly into a period of confinement at the immigration detention center on Christmas Island. While major hospitals on the mainland are equipped to handle serious diseases and pandemics, the island detention center is not—and so, if anyone quarantined develops the disease, they will have to be flown to a major city hospital for treatment in any event. The effect of these policies on some 200,000 students (a proportion of whom are returning from China for the new academic year in Australia) is unclear but will be enormous. Some universities around the world have mandated a period of dormitory confinement; others—such as UC Berkeley—issued advisories implying that xenophobia was an understandable response (since retracted under pressure).\nAs with the extralegal approach pursued by the Australian government, the Philippines government has proposed the use of military facilities on Caballo Island and Fort Magsaysay as quarantine zones. The Russian government has moreover threatened “the deportation of foreign citizens if they have such a disease.” This use of citizenship status as a proxy for detecting COVID19 is likely to ensure noncitizens avoid seeking treatment for associated symptoms—and it is, in any event, unclear how deportation might minimize the spread of the virus.\nThese practices highlight what Howard Markel describes as “quarantine’s aggressive potential for harm.” The harm is—as Markel suggested in his history of the treatment of East European Jewish immigrants in New York at the end of the 19th century—exacerbated for those who happen to find themselves on the “other” side of a quarantine border; its spread cannot be restricted along those lines because a virus is neither synonymous with a group of persons nor can it be identified by a passport.\nWhile the World Health Organization declared COVID19 a serious health emergency, it advised against closed borders as an effective means of handling the virus. It warned that “closing borders was probably ineffective in halting the transmission of the deadly novel coronavirus from China and could even accelerate its spread,” in part because punitive approaches make it that much more difficult for health workers to treat cases and track the spread of diseases.\nImmigration detention emerged from the intertwined histories and techniques of quarantine confinement and prisons. For most of the 20th century, the use of the cordon sanitaire (or “sanitary cordon”) as a public-health measure had largely disappeared—relegated to agricultural protocols at airports and ports but otherwise lingering as the metaphorical accessory of racializing policy—as I discuss throughout my book Contract and Contagion (122, 131-332).\nThe reappearance of the cordon sanitaire since the late 20th century has occurred at the intersection of a number of changes. It has reemerged after decades of a decline of social understandings and treatments of health and disease—or, the privatization of health and the socialization of disease. Further to this, the development of genome sequencing and bioinformatics has made it possible to identify new strains of virus; yet while genetic identification may be important in the development of treatments for some diseases, the ability to identify and map new strains does not imply some postmodern quickening in rates of microbial mutation. And, not least, the resurgence of far-right politics around ethnonationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment have given credence to the fantastical idea that biological purity is a condition of health and life.\nIn what follows, I want to underline four interconnected points:\nFirst, claims that quarantines are effective in containing the spread of viruses such as COVID19 or improving rates of survivability are debatable. The general view is that they are counterproductive.\nAs for the aesthetics that bolster the apparent urgency of quarantine measures: Mathematical models of contagions might furnish dramatic, speculative visualizations of fractal spreads that are able to be restrained by the presumably solid lines of national borders—but they are not real-world, field-tested exercises. Similarly, the terms and numbers used to describe emerging transmissible diseases have become intense conduits of misinformation, as with the reception of the basic reproduction number, or R0. Treated by researchers as a useful but provisional numerical estimate for developing hypotheses about rates of infection, the initial circulation of one such R0 on social media was greeted as if it were evidence of an unfolding apocalypse. Moreover, the use of non-symptomatic proxies (such as nationality) as a means of detecting COVID19 was briefly promoted by the publication of a report which suggested that asymptomatic transmission was possible, but that study has “proven to contain major flaws and errors,” and wrong in its conclusions.\nMeasures other than quarantine have been found much more effective in preventing widespread contagion. In a lengthy review of the research on the comparative effectiveness of a number of measures (short of vaccines and antiviral drugs) to prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses—screening at entry ports, medical isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, and hand hygiene—the use of surgical masks and regular handwashing emerged as the most consistently effective set of physical interventions. The review also found that the medical isolation of symptomatic patients was important but that “global measures, such as screening at entry ports, led to a non-significant marginal delay.”\nAs one scholar from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has put it, “no one should think that there won’t be more cases” simply because there is a travel ban.\nYet even if one were to grant the dubious assumption that the transmission of diseases might be halted (or meaningfully slowed) through territorial restrictions on people’s mobility, the genomic identification of a new strain of virus—while accelerated by the introduction of automated genome sequencing—would invariably occur subsequent to its appearance. In any event, expenditure and focus on quarantine restrictions tend to represent a redirection of resources away from measures likely to be more effective in both the immediate and longer term.\nThat is, quarantines often exacerbate viral dangers, because they foster the illusion that the isolation of a virus is synonymous with (or achievable through) the territorial confinement of groups of people, whose confinement is determined not by whether they are symptomatic or diagnosed with a disease but by a purportedly preemptive measure that uses nationality and geography as a proxy for exposure.\nSecond, the resort to quarantines draws on the biological-racial understanding of nations as discrete organic entities and prevents or displaces a social understanding of health and disease. Quarantines promote the imagination of a conflict between the preservation of presumably well-defined biological categories (the human, the family, the nation, the race) and the viral proliferation of boundary-blurring contagions.\nIt is however doubtful that humans could have evolved without the species-jumping, recombinant action of bacterial genetics transmitted through viral infections. More to the point, all vaccines involve the modified administration of an infection, and immunization is only effective at the largest (rather than national) population scales.\nWhile some media attention has focused on Wuhan’s “wet markets” as the scene of species jumping, the privatization of health care and the socialization of ill-health remains largely ignored as a contributing factor in both infection and mortality rates. As a recent study shows, just over half of those infected with COVID19 in Wuhan’s Jinyintan Hospital had prior underlying chronic illnesses—such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory-system diseases, or malignant tumors.\nFurther, China’s public health-care system was dismantled in the 1980s. This occurred during a period of rapid, fossil-fueled economic changes—and precipitated an enormous rise in (untreated) chronic illnesses, in particular respiratory, cardiovascular, and cardiopulmonary diseases, in a city with some of the worst air pollution in the world. Its air quality has an annual average PM2.5 concentration of over 120μg/m3. By way of comparison, the WHO stipulates an annual average below 10μg/m3, above which total, cardiopulmonary, and lung-cancer mortality have been shown with more than 95 percent confidence to increase.\nAround 97 percent of the deaths presently attributed to COVID19 around the world have been recorded in Wuhan. China’s decentralized, commercially oriented health system and the lack of health-care coverage have, in all likelihood, worsened the impact of any single disease—as some have argued they already did during the SARS outbreak.\nIt may be that the recent construction of dedicated hospitals represents an effort by parts of the Chinese government to expand health-care and insurance coverage—albeit under the administrative control of the military. Which is to say, it is also part of the evolution of a system in which increasingly precarious populations can only access what should be routine health care through their involvement in experimental emergency procedures—which may or may not increase their chances of recovery, but in which they bear most of the risks of (eventually) patented vaccine or other drug or biotechnical developments.\nMeanwhile, the shares of a U.S. biotechnology company, Gilead Sciences, spiked after reports that it would be launching a trial of its antiviral drug (remdesivir) on some 270 patients in China who developed mild to moderate pneumonia after having been infected with COVID19. The WHO recently advised that there is as yet no evidence for the effectiveness of antiviral treatments. Some treatments may yet prove to be effective. But at present they are experiments, speculative endeavors that leverage desperation and are oriented toward the growth of private markets in patented drugs. Moreover, while the open sourcing of data is crucial to health care, there are few if any impediments to its mining for commercial products at a consequently lowered cost.\nAs a consequence of these and other mutually reinforcing systems, there is a broad financial value in substituting a social model of health and disease—which involves a complex understanding of disease transmission and the factors that contribute to illness and mortality rates—with a reductive model amenable to private insurance, the subsidized development of patented drugs or treatments, and the continuing externalization of the downward risks of harmful industries and practices that contribute to ill-health and mortality.\nThird, therefore the combination of the declared emergency, quarantine confinement, and lower regulatory standards significantly diminishes the cost of human drug trials and inflates the value of and market for patented drugs. There is commercial value for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in (speculations on) the development of patented vaccines, antivirals, or broad-spectrum antibiotics through the spatial delineation and immobilization of a cohort of research subjects.\nIndeed, the collapse of public health care in China was accompanied by the introduction of a system in which hospital administrators were permitted “to profit-earn from new pharmaceuticals and medical technologies (after strong lobbying by the relevant multinational corporations), with salary bonuses for the staff involved.” There are a range of industries and practices that can leverage quarantines for gain—the military, detention or security contractors, and those organizations that combine these things with quasi-medical emergency response teams.\nAs it happens, the Australian government has required anyone interned at Christmas Island to sign a waiver—presumably one that indemnifies the government and the private contractors who manage the facility in the event that internment results in infection or other health issues. In other words, the quarantine on Christmas Island will be little more than a means of observing people who are confined for the average time that it takes COVID19 to incubate—if, that is, the virus is present among those detained. It is difficult to see how this exercise might be distinguished from the techniques that would develop a virus among a group of test subjects, whose progression could be mined for data—given that anyone who falls ill, in any way, will have to be moved to a large hospital on the mainland for treatment.\nFourth, and finally, there is political value—for some—in forging a seeming consensus around the purported necessity and urgency of authoritarian population-control measures and restrictions on mobility, one that both is grounded in and fosters the stigmatization of groups of people through a territorial-national, and therefore racialized, association with a disease.\nBy way of a summary, this recent history of quarantine measures does not exactly replicate the cordon sanitaire of earlier centuries. The practical importance of virology in the development of the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries means that quarantine zones are not outside circuits of value, even while the quarantine acts as a means of segregation. The contemporary quarantine represents a merger between the authoritarian governance of populations and the facilitation and growth of private, selective health-care infrastructure. Given the importance of nonselectivity and scale to public health, nationalist approaches to health are more accurately described as a way of privatizing public health by other means.\nOriginally published in The New Inquiry.\n ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"  The genetic identification of a novel strain of coronavirus …","ref":"/news/against-quarantine/","tags":"","title":"Against quarantine"},{"body":" The Aguinaldo guard / J.S. Pughe\n  The surveys continue to conclude that we trust the United States but we don’t trust China. For all the good will most of us feel towards America, it is time we subject this conclusion to further scrutiny.\nFor sure, the best test of America as a trusted ally was when China invaded Philippine territory–Scarborough Shoal off the coast of Zambales–in 2012. Our treaty with the United States says that the US will assist us if we are attacked. And Scarborough Shoal was a downright attack, one which we could not repel. Only the United States could have helped us but it did not.\nWe have always overestimated our relationship with the United States. The reality is that a small laid back country like ours is just an expendable pawn in the game of international geopolitics, and we are ignored because we are not strong like Japan or South Korea.\nAmerican policies towards Asia do not always tally with ours. Mood swings in the United States can also affect its relationship with other countries. At the moment, there seems to be a slow swing towards isolation. This is not because America has lost its dynamism but because it finds that sustaining all its global commitments can be very expensive and can even sap the morale of the party in power and at the same time give strength to the opposition.\nAmerican presidents have always been wary of entanglement in a land war in Asia. This must be uppermost in the minds of those policymakers in Washington when they mulled over the problem of a recalcitrant China in the South China Sea.\nOur South China Sea problem with China has an ominous collateral at home. Realize that 80 percent of the Philippine economy is now in the hands of ethnic Chinese. They came to the Philippines with nothing, and became wealthy through exploitation of the land and the people. The priority, therefore, is for us now to see to it that the economic power of these ethnic Chinese, whose loyalty to the Philippines is in doubt, should be emasculated. The silence of our Filipino Chinese on this crucial issue is deafening. Vietnam is a very good model.\nVietnam has not hesitated to fight the Chinese frontally and yet maintains a close relationship with China. Its economy had been dominated by ethnic Chinese. Cholon, then Saigon’s busiest district, was actually a Chinese enclave. After the triumph of the Revolution in 1975, Vietnam applied a simple solution to its China problem. The Chinese were simply expelled and their properties were confiscated. Several Chinese establishments were set up through the following years, but during the riots some three years ago, when China set up an oil rig in Vietnamese waters, to which the Vietnamese objected furiously, the Chinese factories in Vietnam were burned.\nThe United States has billions of dollars in mothballed war material, and has excuses for why it is niggardly in its military aid to the Philippines, compared with its assistance to other governments. We must be prepared to increase our military capability on our own, to sacrifice for it even. One of our first priorities is to build a navy with fast frigates to patrol and defend our country. We already have shipbuilding facilities to do this.\nWe should have three military academies, the military academy in Baguio, perhaps a naval academy in Cebu, and an air force academy in Davao. The first two years of military study will be spent in Baguio. And in the following four years, army officers will continue in Baguio, while naval officers will be in Davao, and air force officers in Cebu.\nThe ROTC should also be revived. It will be a two-year course, after which anyone aspiring for a military career is qualified to take exams for the military academy. The last six months of the course should be spent with the army units. We will then have ready reserve forces whenever the country needs them. We can gain some lessons from Singapore and Israel.\nWe also should strengthen our ties with our ASEAN neighbors, and also see to it that these ties have military significance. We must always remember that a strong and united ASEAN is our best defense against any imperial design to colonize Southeast Asia. It is important that ASEAN should form a pillar not only in trade and cultural relations but also in our military ties with neighbor countries.\nOur diminished relationship with the United States may be replaced with alliances with other nations – Australia, Japan, South Korea. Because of its consensus decision making process, ASEAN may not be a military deterrent to China’s land grabbing. On the other hand, we can forge alliances with Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\nThe Defense Secretary has asked for a review of our defense treaties with the United States. All military aid from other countries should also be reviewed.\nAn American author described us in the 1930s as “the Orphans of the Pacific.” Perhaps that definition fits us now for, in a sense, to be truly free, we must reject our colonial past and struggle not only to survive but to preserve our hard-won. Orphans know they are alone so they strive hard to prevail.\nTo alter our barnacled attitudes towards the United States means that we will have to be less dependent on the United States for aid; we will also diminish the teacher-pupil relationship. In reviewing our alliances with America, it must be noted that Japan, Korea, and Taiwan took advantage of the American umbrella and market to develop economically and militarily. We did not.\nI remember Joseph Lelyveld, former managing editor of The New York Times. He said it is very difficult for America to take our leaders seriously because they are silly. Herein lies the problem: if we should no longer trust America, with our kind of leaders, can we trust ourselves?\nOriginally published in Philippine Star.\n ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" The Aguinaldo guard / J.S.

That idea excited me, in a dubious capacity as a ‘city explorer’, but at the same time it worried my conscience, because the congestion of Manila is terrible for a myriad reasons, none of which would be pleasing to see replicated somewhere else in our archipelago.\nIt was both a delight and a disappointment then to realize that the nominal vastness of Davao is nothing like that of Manila’s. Delight because, as a tour guide in Museo Dabawenyo dutifully pointed out, more than eighty percent of Davao City’s territory is in fact rural—sparsely populated, fresh, green. And the city government intends to keep most of it that way; there were mentions of development plans and city ordinances intended to limit urbanization (or, euphemistically, ‘development’) of the city’s greener districts. Coming from Manila, it’s certainly refreshing to find a major city government in the country caring, or at least affecting a concern for, nature. (Only time will tell if Davao will stay pro-environment, or be tempted by unsustainable prosperity.)\nOn the other hand, the actual size of urban Davao means that there isn’t as much for me to see around in the way of man-made environments, i.e. city architecture. Downtown Davao, the blocks surrounding the city hall, is a blend of the weariness of Manila’s Quiapo and the sleepiness of my hometown, Malabon. Davao City’s growth so far has definitely been horizontal rather than vertical—Marco Polo Hotel is the only visibly high-rise structure in the downtown area, and serves suitably as a compass if you feel like wandering around. Photo of old buildings located along San Pedro St. in downtown Davao City. Buildings along San Pedro St. in downtown Davao City.\nBuildings along San Pedro St. in downtown Davao City. (DJ Ramones / Reverse Delay)\n  As to why the city’s official boundaries remain so expansive is still unknown to me. The size is absurd when compared to the neighboring territories: Davao City is larger than the rest of the province of Davao del Sur combined. Wouldn’t it be somehow more efficient and effective for governance if the territory were to be chopped up into several cities and municipalities? I can’t be sure, I’m not some public policy expert. I’m guessing that local legislators and executives want to retain the ‘largest city’ title for the vague pride and prestige of a superlative. Competing for the largest, biggest, longest whatever, no matter how Guinness World Records-silly it becomes, is a Filipino hobby after all.\nPithecophaga jefferyi The itinerary for my first-ever visit to Davao City with some friends, last November, consisted of pretty much nothing. We were too cool for a competitive, touristy trip anyway, though my childhood fascination with birds of prey surfaced as an insistence to visit the Philippine Eagle Center. My companions’ non-interest meant I had to take an afternoon alone to the conservation center, far away in Barangay Malagos.\nThis detour from an otherwise adventure-allergic weekend in the city was where I got a feel for the vastness of Davao City. To get to the Eagle Center, I took a bus from Annil Terminal in downtown Davao to Calinan District. It was a forty-minute trip through a highway cutting through definitely-rural scenery. From Calinan, which looks like a town of its own, unconcerned with downtown Davao City, I piggybacked on a motorcycle up to the Malagos Watershed park where the Center resides. I would later look at a map and find that the distance from downtown Davao to Malagos is only one-third of the distance across the city’s official land area. Certainly a huge place, it is. View of the rural landscape on the highway from downtown Davao City to Calinan district. On the highway to Calinan.\n(The location of the Philippine Eagle Center, in a watershed park on the foothills of Mt. Apo, corroborates the environmentally-friendly and ecologically-aware theme of Davao City. Davaoeños, in protecting these watersheds and the other rural regions of the city from urbanization, understand that these are the sources of life for the city, and that keeping them pristine is in their best interests.)\nI don’t recall having seen a Philippine eagle in person before, despite my admiration for the national bird, so the time and adventure it took to get there and back was worth it. My anticipation reached its peak at the entrance to the conservation center, where all guests are made to sanitize their hands and have the bottoms of their footwear dipped on a shallow pool of what I assumed was disinfectant. Surely the eagles are in great, careful hands if this much trouble is taken to protect them from dirty tourists. (As to how they are protected from airborne germs and the visitors’ unsanitized body parts or belongings is another matter, but the gesture is appreciated.)\nThe Philippine eagle is truly majestic. No amount of eagle-watching online can substitute for seeing the huge bird directly with one’s own eyeballs. Out of the many eagles visible to the public in the Center, I took much time particularly watching the eagles named Mindanao and Fighter. These eagles, standing proud with their ruffled crests and sleek brown-and-white plumage, measure an impressive meter in length. But wait until you see one spreading its wings: its wingspan and surface area is the largest of any existing bird in the world, a factoid you wouldn’t have to doubt after witnessing the eagle’s sheer, commanding presence as it poses for flight.\nIncidentally, it was after I saw Mindanao spread his wings that I noticed a part of the eagle I hadn’t noted in pictures before: its freakishly huge, powerful legs. The bird’s length is impressive, its wingspan even more so, but its legs? Compared to other birds I’ve seen it looks out of proportion, though it figures, because the other birds I’ve seen do not eat monkeys. The other birds do not have to seize feisty macaques with nature’s most lethal talons. (In hindsight, the slight fright I felt while watching these eagles is a reminder that birds are descendants of dinosaurs, as the scientific consensus goes.)\nIf there is anything unimpressive or disappointing with my visit to the Philippine Eagle Center, it is the fact that I had to see them in captivity in the Center at all. I watched Mindanao and Fighter in particular because they were the only two eagles in the Center, at the time, who were not obscured behind cage bars. (Though they still had a leg each tied to some post; they’d fly away otherwise, of course). The Philippine eagle is a critically endangered species, and the lesson that impressed me the most from reading the various info-boards in the Center is how this eagle is a strong symbol of the state of Philippine forests. As an apex predator, a predator that is itself prey to no other species, a loft-dweller in the local food chain—each eagle represents the health of a vast parcel of forest. That the eagles’ population is dwindling only proves the deterioration and destruction of the forests they live in.\nThe conservation of Philippine eagles via captive breeding is only a last-resort solution. It is tricky business, because breeding eagles in captivity is problematic—how do we ensure that they are fit for release into the forests? We’re not even talking about the tragedy of eagles out in the wild being killed, rather senselessly, by humans. To truly save the eagles, the only right approach is a holistic approach. Conserve the forests first, and only then can we conserve the eagle. To save the eagle is therefore shorthand for protecting the environment in general.\nThis, and that the eagles are simply beautiful on their own—if I were filthy rich, there’s no debate on where a lot of my charity money would go.\nSuper mountain, super moon To the west of Davao City lies the tallest mountain of the country: Mt. Apo. Given the risk-averse nature of our November trip, getting up close to the mountain was a non-starter, so it just sat there, a massive feature of the western skyline. The closest glimpse I had of it was on the bus trip to Calinan.\nIn the short weekend we spent at Davao, whatever illusions I maintained of finding a vastly different culture in the city were demolished after we visited place after place that all felt too familiar. On Sunday afternoon, after I successfully navigated my way back downtown after my Eagle Center mission, I rendezvoused with my trip-mate, who in turn was meeting up with a Davaoeña acquaintance. This acquaintance turned out to be a recent graduate of a Manila university (like us); the shared background meant we easily understood each other and had an easy conversation. Nothing vastly different there. She brought us to a newly-inaugurated, charming little bistro named Lara Mia, serving sweet desserts in suburban Matina district. It was an establishment that would fit in perfectly in Maginhawa St. in Quezon City, or in BF Homes in Parañaque. Night-time view looking outside from Stre3ts Urban Lifestyle Pub. View from Stre3ts Urban Lifestyle Pub.\nLater my trip-mate and I found ourselves enjoying a beer at a rather hip tavern called Stre3ts. My bottle of choice was Kalinga Kölsch, a crisp craft beer by Crazy Carabao Brewing Company, a product proudly Filipino but certainly not Davao-exclusive. Definitely not a local flavor. Still later, we stumbled onto Balik Bukid, a restaurant on Quimpo Boulevard specializing in organic, farm-fresh produce. The fascination for the organic is clearly an urban thing, something you can find in any city, again nothing vastly different. Finally, on the fine, sunny afternoon of the next day, hours before our flight home, you would have seen me and my two companions appreciating the products in FROG Kaffee on Torres St., a third-wave coffee shop. (Before you begin imagining a café adorned with slimy amphibians, ‘FROG Kaffee’ apparently is an abbreviation for ‘Fresh Roast of Great Kaffee’, the last word being the German form of the word coffee.) If you listened intently to us, you would have heard silly political chit-chat by Manileños talking about the injustice of Manila-centric imperialism. Photo of the afternoon-lit interior of FROG Kaffee in Davao City. An afternoon in FROG Kaffee.\nThese experiences overwhelmingly support the conclusion that this, Davao, is just another Filipino city, all right, distance from Manila notwithstanding. Nevertheless, if you looked closely enough, there are hints here and there of tiny but meaningful differences. At the airport, the canned landing greeting by the airline includes a gentle but firm reminder that, unlike in the undisciplined, careless cities where you, the passenger, came from, there is an anti-smoking ordinance in Davao City that is actually, strictly enforced. (I may have paraphrased that a bit.)\nIt was also a delight that Museo Dabawenyo, unlike the poorly-maintained, under-appreciated local government museums in a great many other places, radiates a sense that the politicians here have a genuine care for local heritage. The museum is air-conditioned, neat, free-admission and, most remarkably, is served by dedicated tour guides. This, while many other Philippine city museums would just leave you wandering around the exhibits on your own.\nIt is from this museum where I finally found the means to see Davao differently. Isn’t that the power of history, the power to enrich a place’s identity? What had seemed to me so far to be a city indistinct from my own hometown was now supplanted by an imagined historical city: one that was formed on the final frontiers of Spanish colonization in the archipelago, one that was, unlike most of Luzon and Visayas, un-Hispanized until only the last half-century of Spanish rule, a city that in the last century or so was a destination for mass Tagalog migrations. This last lesson satisfied my long-standing question as to how Davaoeños became as comfortable with the Tagalog language as they are with Bisaya/Cebuano. Isn’t that great (and nerdy), to have historical facts addressing personal curiosities?\nSatisfied, I left the city with images of superlatives in my mind: the widest land, the largest eagle, the tallest mountain. But then nature conspired to add another hyperbolic element to my trip: on the night of our flight home, there was a supermoon. I peered through the round window of the Airbus, and saw the luminous orb among the stars, showering its radiance on a sea of clouds. Somewhere beyond, the peaks of Mt. Apo rose through the clouds, an illuminated island on an otherworldly ocean, beckoning me to return someday.\nOriginally published in Reverse Delay.\n ","categories":"","description":"Here’s what you learn when you go to Davao just to admire eagles.","excerpt":"Here’s what you learn when you go to Davao just to admire eagles.","ref":"/news/davao-city-of-superlatives/","tags":"","title":"Davao: city of superlatives"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page.

Entire lifetimes and university departments are devoted to these topics, so Joaquin must have thought his essay’s particular subject important enough to warrant a short but dense title. And it is indeed significant, at least for his target audience, Filipinos. In this essay, the author deals with popular beliefs about the birth of Filipino culture, and does so with much wit and wisdom.\nIt was published only about a decade before the 21st century, a circumstance that led me to think about Joaquin’s insights from a present-day perspective. But before that, a review is in order.\nThe essay: crucial points and select quotes Culture as History is one continuous piece of prose, but thematically I see it as having four parts.\nIn the first one, relatively independent from the rest of the essay, Joaquin introduces his inspirations—the intellectuals Marshall McLuhan and Oswald Spengler—and discusses the relationship between literacy and culture. The “modern notion” of illiteracy as ignorance is debunked: if the illiterate peoples of the past were indeed ignorant, how come they were able to build magnificent churches and other cultural wonders which we, today, cherish as national treasures? (It is, after all, the toiling of the masses that actually built these structures, not the plans of the colonial masters.)\nAs if to challenge ideas of modern-culture superiority, Joaquin notes how literate culture is subservient to the faculty of vision, how it is often limited to the spaces of museums, theaters, and galleries; he contrasts this with multi-sensory “folk” culture, which is comprised of everyday experience. At another point, Joaquin shares McLuhan’s idea of a “New Illiteracy” brought by the “era of electronics—TV, tape, transistor.” (Today, we have the Internet, where the verbal—instant messaging—sometimes gives way to the visual—Instagram and video chats.)\nTowards the end of the first part the author takes on the titular concept of cultural history. Drawing from McLuhan, Joaquin contends that history as it is popularly understood today, which is in terms of events, dates, or personalities, is lacking, and that the alternative is a history focused on the introduction of tools (that is, changes in material culture) and how these objects reshape the lives of societies. This leads to the essay’s second part, where Joaquin argues for a new history of the Filipino people, using the viewpoint of cultural history. Some controversial statements are made. For instance:\n “[Filipinos should see] 1521 and 1565 not as the time of the coming of the West to our land but as the time of the coming into our culture of certain tools (wheel, plow, cement, road, bridge,…,etc.)”\n Most notably, Joaquin claims that the Filipino identity, especially its comprising sense of community, emerged not in the 19th century with the Ilustrados, but much earlier, in the 16th and 17th centuries, which is when the peoples of the archipelago were irreversibly changed by the arrival of Western tools and technologies brought by the Spaniards. The idea is that it was not the imagination of a few patriots that enabled a sense of solidarity or community or nation, but the much more widespread experience of a people adjusting to new ways of life.\n(Although, if I may add, if it was not Rizal and his compatriots’ invention, the Filipino nation should at least be grateful for their courageous expression of it.)\nThe third thematic section of Culture as History talks about a ‘cultural soul’, or the existence of an immutable core of a culture’s properties. This is a rather weak idea, built mostly upon rhetoric (pathos) and mentions of ‘destiny’, and recalls progressive views of history. Applied to Filipino cultural history, Joaquin says that the Filipino soul was born through the people’s encounter with Western technology, and that, once born, it could be superficially altered but not fundamentally changed.\n “…the Filipino, because he was created in the 16th and 17th centuries by a tool-forged fusion of tribes from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao; Spanish and Chinese mestizos; etc., and molded into a form by a geography only from then on existing as a political unit, cannot be tracked farther back than that fusion and that form—as no individual existence can be traced farther back than the moment of conception, which determined that what was to be born would be this person and no other.”\n Joaquin even distinguishes between Spanish and American colonization as such: “[the] Spanish advent…produced the Filipino” while the Americans merely “helped us to become more aware of this Filipinoness.”\nThe final, and most substantial, part of the essay deals with the controversy of the archipelago’s Westernization versus its “Asianizing”. Here Joaquin addresses unnamed proponents of the idea that the Filipino soul was ‘corrupted’ and diverted from its ‘Asian destiny’ when the Spaniards arrived. To this, Joaquin bluntly replies:\n “If it be true indeed that we were Westernized at the cost of our Asian soul, then the blame must fall, not on the West, but on Asia.”\n After this ensues, quite entertainingly, narrations and conjectures as to why the country was not “Asianized” in the first place, when the archipelago was there all along, for centuries so near to lands which were successfully influenced by the great Asian cultures: Korea, Formosa/Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, etc. The Philippine archipelago was present there in the crossfire of the militant spread of Hinduism, Islam and other faiths, but it barely had as much as a scratch.\n(Joaquin knows that Islam arrived arrived in the islands in the 14th century, but notes that its spread was so slow that after two centuries and by the time of Miguel López de Legazpi’s arrival it was still limited to Sulu and the southern fringes of Mindanao; at that rate, he calculated, the country would only have been completely converted by the 21st century!)\nEffectively, the archipelago was “ignored” by its “indifferent” neighbors. Viewed this way, in a rather playful analogy, Joaquin imagines Asia as the Wicked Stepmother, our regional neighbors as the favored daughters, Philippines itself as Cinderella and the West as “a rather erratic Fairy Godmother”. If it were not for Western interest, invasion and intervention, Joaquin imagines that the Philippine archipelago would have plodded a stale destiny and ended up like the underdeveloped Pacific islands in Oceania.\nAnticipating counter-claims that the islands were already quite Asian before its Western colonization, Joaquin challenges some popularly-held notions of the status of ‘Philippine’ society at the time of Spanish contact.\nOne, he expresses great doubt that pre-Western Filipinos were a seafaring people who were in routine contact and exposure to our Asian neighbors. Inter-island travellers, perhaps, but not seafaring: here, culture as history proves its worth, because if it is true that in ancient history Filipinos sailed the high seas, how come there is a lack of living cultural artifacts as evidence? Joaquin says that great books could be burned, but memories of it cannot be erased in a people; many ancient Greeks plays have been lost, but the dramatists who wrote them and the titles and number of their works are still known, thanks to oral traditions. What does it say about the Filipino past that our epics and myths have for their settings only dry land, and rivers at most, but never the open sea? We have a Dayang Makiling of the mountain but not a lady of the sea—the sirena does not count, being apparently of Western origin.\nTwo, Joaquin says that the ancient porcelain wares that Filipino museums and archaeologists treasure so much do not prove the wide reach of pre-Western Filipinos into the rest of Asia; but on the contrary it shows how people in the archipelago were at the mercy of the foreign traders who bothered to travel to Philippine shores.\n “[The porcelain shows] lack of technology on our part and, on the part of the Chinese, an exploitation of that technological ignorance…we should be so ashamed of them…our first obsession with the ‘imported’…”\n Three, Joaquin invokes common sense and says that:\n “It just doesn’t seem possible that we went to China and saw their roads and then came back and went on using jungle trails…”\n He makes the same observation for other Asian technologies that, if the pre-Western Filipino indeed travelled much to his neighbors, should have been imported to the islands, but were not.\nFour, Asian maps of the Philippines were incredibly inaccurate or lacking, even by the 16th century. It is such a strong argument against the significance of the archipelago’s place in pre-16th century Asia that Joaquin felt moved to modify the infamous historiographical statement:\n “Even for Asia, the Philippines was ‘discovered’ in 1521.”\n The next points of Joaquin’s essay serve to temper his earlier attacks on Asia and the West’s places in our history (lest he be accused of actually favoring our Western heritage over our Asian side; he does not, as he makes clear later on). For all its ignorance of the Philippines before Spanish conquest, the Asians played catch-up afterwards. We were, so to speak, “Asianized” even as we were being Westernized. The Chinese immigrated in huge numbers to the archipelago under Spanish watch, introducing their cuisine to our kitchens. (Although the fact that we call Chinese dishes by Hispanic names–pancit guisado, asado, and many others—demonstrates again, via culture as history, that Philippine cuisine only acquired Chinese tastes after Spanish conquest.)\nAlso, Filipino traits, which to this day are considered cultural baggages slowing down our progress as a society, and which are usually blamed to our Asian heritage, may in fact be attributed as much to our Westernization.\n “Confusion is compounded by the qualities usually cited as ‘typically’ Asian…Greek fatalism…Celtic languor and sloth…intense Teutonic blood and clan ties…Latin touchiness and vendetta…”\n Finally, Joaquin suggests that rather than bring blame upon this or that historical did or didn’t, we should abandon the what-ifs and be at peace with our past, and even take pride in our hybrid heritage. The nation’s Westernization and “Asianizing” were two processes that eventually worked together to create this unique culture, the Pearl of the Orient Seas, a people that carries the living treasures of many ages from many lands. As Joaquin puts it,\n “Shouldn’t we rather recognize that each person is a sort of unconscious anthology of all the epochs of man; and that he may at times be moving simultaneously among different epochs?”\n “Unconscious anthology”—I have not encountered a more beautiful phrase to concisely describe the richness of society, and the heritage of its individuals.\nA tall, modern building under construction, viewed through an old doorway in Manila's Fort Santiago. Technologies play a critical part in the construction of culture. (DJ Ramones / Reverse Delay)\n  Culture as history unfolding today Philippines under new technologies Joaquin’s essay touches our nation’s timeline only up until the American occupation, and only barely so. The most obvious direction for expanding on his thoughts would therefore be the current state of Filipino culture, specifically in how it is being shaped by new technologies.\nPerhaps the most significant phenomenon affecting culture in all nations beginning in the 20th century would be globalization. This trend, which was brought about by advancements in transportation, communication and trade, is enabled by parallel advances in technology. (Some would say that globalization started far earlier with far simpler technologies, such as during the Roman Empire’s expansion which brought roads to many new territories; but it’s clear that in scope and reach, globalization took a massive leap forward only in the 20th century.) For many people in the early 21st century, however, the term technology has come to nearly exclusively denote information technology. And perhaps justly so; while the other technologies involved in globalization are worthy of a closer look, it is information technology that is most dynamic and seems to have caused the most disruption in culture.\nThere are two sides to this new ubiquitous technology of the Internet and computing devices. On one hand, in its capability for defying geography and breaking boundaries, technology has enabled communities spanning across countries and tied together by specific interests. It can even be said that the Internet has already spawned its own cultures, with its users bound together by a common experience. This experience takes the form of the specialized knowledge required to use the Internet (especially in its earlier days, when it was much less ‘user-friendly’), such as expertise with computer software and hardware, some technical and social jargon (‘LOL’, ‘BRB’), and even the accidental ‘rituals’ such as listening to the peculiar tones emitted by dial-up modems.\nFor Filipinos, who in the physical world are experiencing a kind of diaspora as OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers), contemporary technologies has allowed us to maintain ties that in earlier centuries would have been difficult to keep.\nOn the other hand, there are other kinds of boundaries that have sprung up in the ‘cyberspace’ that the new technologies built. The ease of creating communities around specific interests has also meant a tendency to be too absorbed in these particular communities; the seemingly boundless freedom to unite with those who are similar to ourselves, have also reduced our exposure to those who are unlike or disagree with us. We are seeing the benefit and harm of these circumstances: we see those who aspire for democracy in the Middle-Eastern nations finding peers through the Internet during the Arab Spring of 2011; at the same time, the destructive flames of extremism embodied by ISIS and similar groups have also propagated through these contemporary technologies.\nThe visual and aural forms that make up these new media also support the natural boundaries of languages. Languages unite their speakers, while excluding those who don’t speak them. (While advances have been made in fast and automatic translations of text on the Internet, allowing users of various tongues to understand each other at a basic, transactional and utilitarian level, the state of the technology is still insufficient for meaningful cultural exchange.) These online language barriers have created the ironic phenomenon of globally-available but only locally-popular Internet ‘sensations’. An example in the Philippines is 2015’s AlDub love team, which, while it has so thoroughly captivated Filipino audiences that it inspired them to break social media activity records, is very much limited to those who understand its language. Even if effort is spent on translating the franchise’s TV shows and other media appearances, such that it can be functionally understood by speakers of a much more widespread language as, say, English, it is highly doubtful that the appeal can be carried over. In short, much of it, as they say, will be lost in translation.\nIt should be clear that Internet phenomena like this, where the experience is intense but the reach is limited by language, is abundant. I recently looked at Twitter’s year-end report on top 2015 hashtags, and found many topics written in unfamiliar characters: experiences that have enchanted Koreans or Argentinians or Germans, but which the English-speaking world, often assumed to be dominant on the information superhighway, knows nothing about. These experiences impart collective memories to their audiences; and these memories generate the sense of solidarity so crucial to the unity of a culture.\nThe usual alarm raised against globalization is its tendency to homogenize cultures, to erode and eventually destroy specifics and localities in favor of globally dominant ‘strains’. What our description of localized Internet phenomena shows, however, is the often-overlooked counter-tendency, within globalization, of magnifying local cultures. Although individual mobility has weakened the tight construction of societies, delineations along cultural lines continue to be powerful at the community and larger levels, despite globalization.\nPhysical space and boundaries continue to be important. The technologies of the 21st century, although they will always threaten to diminish the Filipino identity, seems poised instead to empower its further development: and time will tell if this new chapter in our culture will pass on to become new chapters in history as well.\nThe Moro Problem While Nick Joaquin’s essay sheds some light into the future of Filipino society by providing a local context to the material-culture-as-history idea first popularized by McLuhan and Spengler, his assertion that the Filipino culture was born in the 16th and 17th centuries clashes with the present “Moro problem”.\nThe decades-old conflict that the Moro South continues to suffer has often been traced to their difficulty identifying with the rest of Christian (Westernized) Philippines. It is a cultural-historical divide: the Moro people did not have the experience of adapting to Western tools and technologies that the Spaniards brought, and therefore never shared in the solidarity of the other ‘tribes’ of the country. This divide is precisely what prompted some nationalists to search for an ancient, unifying, pre-Christian, pre-Muslim national identity—a culture which, if it can still be found, Joaquin might deem irrelevant, a futile what-if in the face of the Filipino culture that has taken root in most of the rest of the archipelago.\nHowever, even if Joaquin’s stand clashes with efforts to find a more-encompassing notion of Filipino history, it is not incompatible with the latest steps on the road to peace. The proposed Bangsamoro sub-state, to be established with the delayed Bangsamoro Basic Law, is perhaps an acknowledgment of the cultural differences of the Moro region from the rest of the Filipino nation.

He is also known by the stage name or band name Markus Highway.\nEraserheads During his days as lead guitarist for the Eraserheads, Adoro only had a few contributions when it came to songwriting. He would compose one song per album, which were usually album fillers, like “Punk Zappa” in the album, Circus, and “Southsuperhiway” in the album, Natin99. The most contributions he had ever given to the band was in the album Carbon Stereoxide, in which he wrote the songs “Pula”, “Wala”, and “Escalator Alligator”.\nAdoro’s style of lead guitar was a very significant piece to the Eraserheads' sound, and to a greater extent, using takamine, Gibson and Yamaha the sound that came to define Pinoy alternative rock. His minimalist approach contrasted with the “flashier” style of most local guitarists of the time. Instead of long, epic solos, Adoro preferred “pretty little ditties” that often complement the tone of the song. His “less is more” method resembles that of many guitarists from Manila’s ’80s underground punk scene, particularly Bobby Balingit (The Wuds) and Resty Cornejo (Identity Crisis). During the band’s later years, Adoro began to acquire a fascination with electric guitar noises and environmental sounds which he would incorporate to his style as the band’s music progressed and became more experimental.\nProjects after Eraserheads “Kamonkamon” Adoro explains in an interview with Philmusic.com that Kamonkamon was “meant as a hype.” According to him, around 2002, BMG records had already bought the whole work, consisting of a comicbook, the comicbook soundtrack and a video documentary CD. The album, though, was not to be released until 2005. In addition, BMG would only publish the work if the comicbook is shortened, which according to Adoro, defeats the purpose of the comicbook soundtrack and the idea of the whole work. He says that Kamonkamon “is a highly philosophical work,” so he declined with the condition. “The eventual release of Kamonkamon would be just the tip of the iceberg so to speak,” says Adoro.\nAdoro was not the first Eraserhead to produce his own solo project. In 2000, lead vocalist Ely Buendia released his album, Wanted: Bedspacer.\n“Belma en Luis” In the same year Kamonkamon was released, Eraserheads vocalist, Ely Buendia, left the band to form The Mongols. Adoro, later, also decided to quit. He would eventually move to La Union and was unheard from until the April 2005. An e-mail from him was sent to PhilMusic.com about a new project he was working on, called “Surfernando: The Adventures of Belma and Luis,” with a poster art of a pencil stuck in a person’s nose. The EP turned up once again at Sarabia Optical. It is also available in different album covers and titles: Urfer Magazine (Mag:Net Café), Duckdive (Bigsky), American Gurl (United States version), and Submarine (Marikina version)\nIn the interview with Philmusic.com, Adoro explains that “Belma en Luis” is half of all the songs for a “pinoy surfing album.” Surfernando is a character. He wrote the songs in 2003 after three years of surfing. He recorded and released his work on major labels, and has now shopped for a deal with Warner Music. The Surfernando songs were recorded in his new band Markus Highway’s debut album called Behold, Rejoice! Surfernando Is Hear Nah.. The sound of Markus Highway ranges from just him and a guitar “to a big full band with horns section and all.”\nCareer after Eraserheads Adoro’s current band name is “Markus Highway (a wordplay on “Marcos Highway,” a Philippine road). Adoro explains that “Markus Highway” is just a rock and roll name that he likes and he wants to keep at the moment. He says that he’s good with wordplay. He reveals that most of the Eraserheads album titles came from him. “I like changing names because it’s an old rock n roll tradition. All the old travelling bluesmen used different aliases and my favorite cool bands do it. I like Markus Highway for the Surfernando song,” says Adoro. Adoro had changed his stage name or band name quite often since 2001. His different band names since 2001 include Surfernando, The Gumamela Band, Kamonkamon, The Flaming Katols, Markus Regime (a wordplay on Marcos Regime), The Mamones (a name spoof of Mamon, a Filipino sponge cake, and The Ramones) and Talampunay Band. He eventually settled to Markus Highway since 2007.[3]\nAdoro along with former bandmates, Buddy Zabala and Raimund Marasigan performed for an event at the Millennia Club called “Marooned”, a production of UP bands from past and present. Buendia was invited to the gig, but was not able to attend. “Batch 88”,[4] from Belma en Luis, was one of the songs that was jammed by the trio.\nWhen asked about his career plans in the Philmusic.com interview, Adoro said that he plans to get session musicians to play in the recording of the Surfernando album, get a band ready for gig tours, and work with other willing back-up bands as well. He said that he had been backed by artists such as Mano-manu and Sunflower Day Camp. He just finished a low-key bar tour with the band, Mayonnaise and Sunflower Day Camp.\nAdoro unexpectedly appeared in “LivELY: A Fundraising Concert for the Benefit of Ely Buendia” on January 28, 2007. Though not in the list of performers, Adoro suddenly walked on stage before Rivermaya had finished performing. He then borrowed Mike Elgar’s guitar and played a reggae rendition of the Eraserheads song, “Huwag Mo Nang Itanong”, and a song from his new album.[5]\nMarcus Adoro has a new band named Markus Highway under Warner Music Philippines, their first album “Behold, Rejoice! Surfernando Is Hear Nah.” was released on February 2008.\nLife after Eraserheads Adoro was interviewed by GMA-7 newscaster Jessica Soho on her show, “Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho.” The topic is all about La Union which is now popular for beach surfers in the Philippines. He is now based in La Union and he enjoys his new life as a local surfer.\nIn the Philmusic.com interview, Adoro says he surfs, but he doesn’t join competitions. He does not compete because he says that surfing is not his profession, and he just enjoys the lifestyle. He has been making documentaries about surfing since 2002.\nHe also directed the short film “The Artist Is In” which premiered along with Ely Buendia’s short film “Waiting Shed”. It was followed by “Violator Copy,” a compilation of Adoro’s unreleased videoworks which featured various local artists and surfers, Jericho Rosales, Dong Abay, and Pepe Smith.\nIn 2012 he started the project “Greems”- a collection of 100 musical pieces, played in the same chord progression, all in the same key and all pieces clocking in at 57 seconds. The 100 pieces were written and recorded in 21 days. When asked why the handle “johnlennonfull2”, he says “it was an instruction from a voice that came to him in his dream. The words to Greems will be released as a book before the year 2012 ends.[6]\nControversy In September 2019, Marcus' daughter, singer Syd Hartha, and Marcus' ex-partner, actress Barbara Ruaro, both took to social media suggesting physical and psychological abuse inflicted by Marcus.\nFilmography  Run Barbi Run as Himself (Eraserheads)  Discography Studio album  Behold, Rejoice!

Widely regarded as one of the most respected music icons in the country, his compositions gained massive commercial success and universal critical acclaim, topping various music charts and leaving a legacy in Philippine popular culture. He currently performs as guitarist and lead vocalist for Apartel.\nPersonal life Buendia was born in his parents' home in Naga City at 6:20 am on November 2, 1970. He is the second child of Ely Revilla Buendia (born c. 1942 in Goa, Camarines Sur) and Lisetta Ruiz Basiño (March 22, 1942 in Caramoan, Camarines Sur – August 28, 2008 in Manila). His parents were married on October 30, 1964 in Ragay, Camarines Sur. He first learned Kundiman from his mother while he started playing the guitar at the age of 7 years old. Buendia graduated from Elementary in Pasig Catholic College in 1983 in Pasig City and High School in University of Perpetual Help Rizal. Buendia later enrolled to University of the Philippines Diliman where he formed his bands Bluidie Tryste, Sunday School and Eraserheads.\nBuendia has two children, Una Aurea, with his first wife, Vicky Cayago, and Eon Drake, with Pupil co-manager Diane Ventura. He had a relationship with Andi Trinidad of Mega Magazine and reportedly also used to date TV5 news anchor and model Shawn Yao.\nEraserheads (1989–2002) In December 1989, Ely Buendia, Raimund Marasigan, Marcus Adoro and Buddy Zabala formed Eraserheads in their collegiate school, the University of the Philippines Diliman, where Buendia was a Film major at the College of Mass Communications (he started his first year of college in 1987). The band found that they weren’t good at covering other people’s hits, so they concentrated on writing their own material instead. In 1991, Buendia explained, “After all, if we committed a mistake no one would recognize it since they don’t know the song, right?” Performing their original songs live soon earned them a cult following in the University, which gradually spread outside the campus. One of the songs, a pop song entitled “Pare Ko”, which Buendia wrote, became very popular, partly because of the lyrics which included a few swear words.\nEraserheads eventually signed a three-year deal with BMG Pilipinas. Their debut album Ultraelectromagneticpop! featured Pare Ko and a host of other novelty pieces that had people listening and discovering more about the quartet. The album also brought the underground college rock scene into public awareness. 1993 saw the emergence of “Eraserheadsmania” because of successive hit singles, sold-out concerts and thousands of fans.\nBuendia continued to write songs for the band, many of which became hit singles and classics. Eraserheads lasted for ten years before finally breaking up with Buendia and Adoro’s departure. During those 10 years, the band produced eight studio albums along with other EPs and singles. Their gigs took them out of the country, with tours in the United States and other countries. One album, Aloha Milkyway, was released in the Asian region. Eraserheads were also the first ever Filipino artists to receive the “Moon Man” trophy for winning the 1997 MTV Asia Viewer’s Choice Award for the video of their song, “Ang Huling El Bimbo”. This hit was also written by Buendia, like many others that the band produced.\nEraserheads went onstage for their reunion concert on August 30, 2008 at the Fort Open Field, Taguig City, which was cut short unexpectedly. The continuation of the concert was held at the SM Mall of Asia Concert Grounds on March 7, 2009.\nLeaving Eraserheads After weeks of speculation, it was confirmed that Buendia had left the band in mid-March 2002 for “reasons unknown”. However, in subsequent interviews, Buendia referred to business matters as the cause of the band’s break-up.\nIn an interview, Marasigan said he was eating in SM Megamall, a local shopping mall, when he heard of the news (how he heard of it, was not clear). He said he was “semi-surprised” and wondered if Zabala already knew about it. Adoro told of the story now famous among Eraserheads fans about Buendia’s cryptic text message. He said Buendia stated in the text message that it’s already time to graduate. Adoro quipped in the same interview that Buendia being the first to graduate was natural, since he was in batch 1987 in their school (UP, Diliman), while they were in batch 1988.\nZabala confesses in an interview that disbanding had not been that far away from the members' minds. He said that there were so many occasions where they could have disbanded but they did not. Adoro expressed the belief of some people that the band was getting too old and that it was “selfish” for the band to continue, likely referring to comments about how it’s time for other bands besides Eraserheads to shine. The band made it clear, though, that Buendia’s departure from the band wasn’t in any way violent and there was no shouting (sigawan) or any confrontation.\nWithout giving up, the three remaining original Eraserheads decided to continue on. Within just a few weeks, the “new” Eheads debuted at Hard Rock Cafe in Makati City on April 19 featuring a female singer-guitarist, Kris Gorra-Dancel from the band, Fatal Posporos. However, after a few months, Adoro also quit the band. The remaining members of Eraserheads added Diego Mapa and Ebe Dancel to their lineup and renamed their band, “Cambio”.\n2003–present The Mongols After Ely left Eraserheads, he would invite musicians and jam together. He had no definite line-up at that time, “I have, like, 10 members in the band right now. I have two drummers, two bass players…” according to Ely in an interview with Martin Nievera. This jamming together with friends would eventually evolve into The Mongols. It was composed of guitarist J. Astro (also known as Jerome Velasco) (of The Teeth), bassist Yan Yuzon, drummer Bogs “Boga Man” Jugo (of the indie pop band Daydream Cycle), and Buendia on guitars and vocals, under the stage name Jesus “Dizzy” Ventura. The band was managed by Day Cabuhat, one of Eraserheads' former managers. According to one of Eraserhead’s event producers, Ely’s “Jesus” stage name was from an inside joke during Eraserhead’s US Tour. Ely and Marcus bought replica sheriff badges at the Universal Studios Hollywood and Ely got a badge with the name “Jesus” while Marcus' was “Cesar”.\nThe Mongols released a self-produced underground EP in CD-R format with factory-printed sleeves in April 2003, “A Fraction of A Second”. It contains five tracks, “Case Logic”, “No”, “Tomorrowland”, “KSP” and “Abstraction of A Second”. It was released under Redrum Records.\nAfter a few months, the Mongols decided to have their self-produced album distributed by Neo Records Inc. under the major label VIVA Records. The result is a thirteen-track album called Buddha’s Pest. Its tracks include “Keeper”, “Bulakbol”, “Bakit Nga Ba?”, “Pony”, “Teka Muna”, “Candy Flip”, “Heroine”, “Wig Out”, “It’s Over”, “Irish Spring”, “Odd Even”, “Your Bushido”, plus an untitled instrumental track. It was produced by The Genghis Klan under Criminal Records.\nPupil Shortly after The Mongols' guitarist, J. Astro, left the band, the remaining members renamed their group Pupil. Buendia chanced upon the band name while reading a medical book. The band is enjoying more mainstream popularity, in contrast to the Mongols. Bogs left the band after their 1st album Beautiful Machines. Wendell is now the drummer of Pupil. Recently, Pupil’s guitarist Yanny Yuzon also left the band in 2013. Day Cabuhat Pupil’s Manager said that “Yanny is no longer. Transitions and changes are normal within any band structure and we all thank you for the understanding and continued support of all of our projects…”\nThe Oktaves The band consists of Ely Buendia as the frontman, Nitoy Adriano as the lead guitarist, Chris Padilla also in Guitars, Ivan Garcia on bass and Bobby Padilla on drums. “Nitoy Adriano is a former member of quintessential Filipino rock band The Jerks. They are the original alternative and blues band of the Philippines. Current and past members are considered icons in the local music scene,” MCA Music, Inc. said. “Chris Padilla, Bobby Padilla and Ivan Garcia are actually a three piece rockabilly group called Hilera. They may be new players in the scene compared to the other two members but they have already made quite an impact by winning the Nescafe sound school competition in 2005 and by being nominated and winning various rock awards,” MCA added.\nHow the band was formed, MCA Music, Inc. said, “The members have collaborated several times before most notably when Hilera took part in the production of Buendia’s project with Francis Magalona entitled ‘In Love and War’. However, the band was officially formed almost exactly a year ago when they first went onstage as “Oktaves” when they performed at the inaugural Esquire (magazine) ball.” “The collaboration turned into a headlining band which now plays in the best rock venues in the country. They now have a repertoire of original songs and also perform a good number of classic rock anthems. Oktaves' brand of music is straight up rock n' roll. Their music is very relatable to various audiences of different generations. Whilst their sound is classy and sophisticated, they are also very appealing to the mainstream crowd,” MCA Music Inc. said.\nTheir 1st album was the self-titled album The Oktaves it has 12 tracks including their 1st single “K.U.P.A.L (K.P.L)”, their another single “Paakyat ka pa lang, Pababa na ako” and the song “Bungo Sa Bangin” by Ely Buendia feat. Turbogoth and Pepe Smith from the album Rock Rizal, an album tribute for José Rizal, it consist of Various Artists including Ely Buendia.\nApartel In 2016, Buendia launched a new band with Jay Ortega (of DRT, Gnash, Wally Gonzalez, and Tres), which is primarily focused on soul music, RnB, funk, and semblances of jazz. Buendia met Ortega during the latter’s launch of his bar and cafe called Spin Cafe. The two later collaborated and started to form a group, with members and contributors Pat Sarabia (drums), Coco Coo (guitars), RJ Pineda (keyboards), Redge Concepcion (guitars), Louie Talan (bass), Carissa Ramos (bass), Deej Rodriguez (percussion), Roxy Modesto (saxophone), Wowie Ansano (trumpet), Pards Tupas (trombone), Joseph Cabañero (saxophone), Donna Sagun Señoran(harp and backup vocals), and Ramonne Rodriguez (backup vocals). Buddy Zabala (bass), Nitoy Adriano (guitars), Cooky Chua (backup vocals), Wendell Garcia (drums), and the group Bras Pas Pas Pas (horns), also shared their expertise to the band’s album tracks. Entitled “Inner Play”, the band’s first album was released digitally on September 29, 2016. The double album 45RPM vinyl version was manufactured in Japan, and the band opted not to release in CD format due to piracy and decreasing number of CD users, which was released on November 12, 2016 at the HiFi Show, Dusit Thani Hotel. Inner Play will be released under Buendia and Ortega’s own record label called Offshore Music. According to Buendia in an interview with Myx, their band name was inspired by the 1980s new wave band, The Motels. However, according to Buendia, Apartel’s sound is a tribute to 1970s music, such as Stax Records, Motown, Manila Sound, APO Hiking Society, VST \u0026 Co., and Rico J. Puno. The band launched its first music video for their single “Is It Hip?” on September 17, 2016, in Victoria Court, Malate, and was directed by Marie Jamora and produced by Artikulo Uno Productions. The band also covers songs from its influences such as Sly \u0026 Family Stone’s “Thank You For Talking To Me Africa”. The band released Inner Play (Remixes) in 2017. Its latest album, “Full Flood”, was released in 2018.\nHealth On January 7 2007, Ely Buendia suffered a heart attack or acute myocardial infarction secondary to arterial blockage. It began when Buendia complained about finding it a bit hard to breathe while they were on the way to a gig in Laguna. But he dismissed it as mere heartburn. After some time, Buendia was reportedly in the middle of a song during a gig in Calamba, Laguna when he felt a sudden pain in his chest and left arm. He was rushed to an intensive care unit at the Asian Hospital and Medical Center in Alabang, Muntinlupa. “It turns out that he’d been having a heart attack for the last twenty five hours.” according to ex-eheads manager Jessica Zafra. Doctors performed an angiogram on the frontman and it confirmed the heart attack as two of his arteries were blocked. Buendia’s condition was confirmed stable after an emergency angioplasty operation headed by Dr. Benjie Luna during the same night. According to Dok Sergio, “Ely is fine, successful yung surgery last night. (Last night’s surgery was a success).”\nThe second angioplasty operation conducted on Ely Buendia on January 10, 2007 was successful and is secured from having heart attack recurrence. “The operation was a super success. He is totally out of danger and heart attack recurrence is not expected.” according to Buendia’s attending physician and cardiac surgeon, Dr. Wilfred Dee.\nOn behalf of Pupil, Ms. Day Cabuhat and Diane Ventura gave major thanks to everyone who called, visited and expressed their concerns to Buendia’s condition such as fans, writers, editors, media, sponsors, networks, producers, and most especially to local musicians such as Yael Yuzon, Japs Sergio, Francis Magalona, Parokya ni Edgar, Kamikazee, Kiko Machine, Menaya, Rico Blanco, Urbandub, Buddy Zabala, Marcus Adoro and many others. Buendia was finally released from hospital and was allowed to stay home and rest by his doctors by the night of January 15, 2007. “I’ve got a bionic heart now,” joked by Buendia.\nThis event prompted rap artist Francis Magalona, a longtime friend of Buendia and the other Eraserheads, to state the following in his personal blogsite: “Fast forward to right now, 9:58 am, Jan. 9, a lot of what ifs scenarios pop in my head. What if the E-heads members are back, like long-lost blood brothers? What if “the most significant OPM band of Pinoy Rock” would be in one room, what would happen?” And in postscript he adds, “Para sa akin panahon na para mag-reunite ang E-heads. Sugod na mga kapatid…rock \u0026 roll na hanggang umaga.”, which roughly translates, “For me, it’s time for E-Heads to reunite. Let’s go brothers…rock \u0026 roll until the morning comes.”\nEly’s first on-stage public appearance after his heart attack was on Saturday 10 February 2007 as his band, Pupil, performed at The Music Hall in SM Mall of Asia, in an Animax event called “Love Is In The Air”. The event featured a speed dating event as a welcome celebration for Valentine’s Day and live performances from other local artists such as Callalily, and Amber. Pupil is also part of “Super Proxy Jam”. It is an event that is hoping to spread awareness for the importance of Cardiovascular Health and for the benefit of The Heartist Foundation Inc. Francis Magalona \u0026 The Hardware Syndrome, Parokya Ni Edgar, Gloc-9, Dicta License, PiKaSO, and Dice \u0026 Mobbstar are also participants in the said event. Heartist Foundation Inc. is another collaborative effort between Ely Buendia and Francis Magalona that aims to help Filipino artists with health problems.\nEraserheads reunion Buendia joined Marasigan, Adoro, and Zabala for a one-night-only reunion show on August 30, 2008, at The Fort Open Grounds, In Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City. The concert, however, was cut short after Biendia collapsed due to emotional stress. They were already halfway of a planned 30-song setlist as Ely reportedly collapsed backstage during a break and was rushed to the Makati Medical Center. He was, however, reported to be in stable condition. Buddy had checked on Ely in his tent right after they went to their planned 20 minute break and saw that he already was on an oxygen mask with paramedics checking his blood pressure. As he left and came back, paramedics already took Ely on an ambulance. Bandmates Buddy, Raimund and Marcus further said that they had no idea that Ely was already having difficulty performing. Results showed that Buendia suffered from a slight attack and Hypokalemia. The doctors at Philippine Heart Center had found another blocked artery and performed angioplasty right away, which is Buendia’s third since 2007. On September 5, 2008, Buendia was discharged from the hospital.\nOther works Literature   Ely Buendia had a broadsheet column, entitled “CURSOR”, published weekly (every Saturday) in the Entertainment Section of the Manila Bulletin.

Although due to lack of indications and confirmations from the band and related organizers that time, it was quite unclear if the song was actually from the band or was an old solo project of Ely or the vocals of the said song just sounded like Ely. Until recently, the song was finally confirmed, heard and witnessed when the band played it (titled “Text LUK4”) live during the finale of DPC Yellow Pages’ “Luk4 The Million – City Adventure Challenge” held on December 8, 2006 at the Metrowalk. Although Pupil plays it during live performances, the song itself was a side project of Ely’s. Ely Buendia was included in a commercial project for San Miguel Beer’s Red Horse product line, alongside various Filipino Rock icons: Basti Artadi from Wolfgang, Marc Abaya from Kjwan, Kevin Roy from Razorback, and Pepe Smith from Juan dela Cruz Band.

That’s the last time Mali saw another elephant,” Ely added. The frontman of “Pupil” and “Oktaves” hopes that “people will join me in calling for Mali’s transfer to a sanctuary where she can finally be free to act like an elephant and engage in the behavior that comes naturally to her.”\nAdapted from Wikipedia, under Creative Commons license.\n","categories":"","description":"Filipino musician","excerpt":"Filipino musician","ref":"/wiki/ely-buendia/","tags":"","title":"Ely Buendia"},{"body":"Eraserheads was a Filipino rock band formed in 1989. Consisting of Ely Buendia, Buddy Zabala, Marcus Adoro, and Raimund Marasigan, the band became one of the most successful, most influential, critically acclaimed, and significant bands in the history of Philippine music, leaving a legacy that made them the most commercially successful Filipino music artist of all time. Often dubbed as “The Beatles of the Philippines”, they are credited for spearheading a second wave of Manila band invasions, paving the way for a host of Philippine alternative rock bands.\nThe band released several singles, albums, and EPs that reached number one and achieved commercial success with their third album Cutterpillow, which achieved platinum status several times. They received the Viewer’s Choice Award at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards in New York, the only Filipino artist to have received the award before the conception of the MTV Asia Awards.\nHistory 1989–1992: Formation and early years In 1989, two college bands from the University of the Philippines Diliman were both in search of new members for a new group. Curfew, which consisted of Buddy Zabala on bass, Raimund Marasigan on drums, and Marcus Adoro on guitars met up with Sunday School, which consisted of Ely Buendia on vocals and Raimund Marasigan as session drummer in December of the same year. Ely’s first two college bands, Bluidie Tryste and Sunday School, were too unstable, so he posted an audition notice on a university message board. Only Raimund, Buddy, and Marcus showed up at the audition. According to an interview with myx, Raimund said he first auditioned as bassist while Buddy as the drummer. But they noticed that it did not sound right, the two switched places.\nThe four formed a new group and called themselves Eraserheads, taking inspiration from the film Eraserhead by surrealist director David Lynch. They played mostly covers, doing gigs in schools, and playing at Manila’s rock club circuit, achieving little success.\nThe band found that they were not good at playing covers, so they concentrated on writing their own material. Their new, original songs, played live, soon earned them a cult following in the university, which gradually spread outside the campus. One of the songs, a pop song entitled, “Pare Ko”, became popular, partly because of lyrics that included a few obscenities.\nThe band recorded a nine-song demo tape in the garage of Marasigan’s provincial home (in Candelaria, Quezon) on January 26, 1991. They then shopped the demo cassette around record labels, clubs, and radio stations, hoping to have their songs reach the public. However, they were rejected at every turn, with one recording label deeming that their demo was “not pop enough”. In May 1991, a professor-friend teaching Humanities, Robin Rivera, helped them re-record and mix better versions of the demo songs on a four-track DAT recorder. The new demo was named Pop-U!, titled as an irreverent response to those who turned them down.\nMeanwhile, Buendia became employed as a student copywriter by BMG Records (Pilipinas) Inc. (now part of Sony BMG Music Entertainment). He worked with BMG during the day and wrote songs with the band during the night. Eventually, the songs of Buendia and the band caught the attention of BMG A\u0026R director Vic Valenciano. Valenciano listened to the songs and then commented that they were very raw technically, but that there was something promising in them. Subsequently, BMG gave Eraserheads' songs a try. In 1992, BMG signed up the band for a three-year record deal.\n1993–1997: Mainstream success In July 1993, Eraserheads started recording their debut album called Ultraelectromagneticpop!. The album featured “Pare Ko” (My Friend), “Toyang” and “Tindahan ni Aling Nena” (The Store of Aling Nena), all of which were also present in Pop-U!. The album also featured a sanitized version of “Pare Ko” called “Walang Hiyang Pare Ko”. Later in the same year, BMG initially released 5,000 copies of the album. The album became a smash hit, with the songs “Ligaya”, “Pare Ko” and “Toyang” topping the charts that, by the end of the year, BMG sold 300,000 copies, and Ultraelectromagneticpop! turned sextuple platinum.\nThe album met some opposition as the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) attempted to censor “Pare Ko” but without success. The public was said to have found its OPM Fab Four in Eraserheads, opening the second wave of band invasion. The Eraserheadsmania was born.\nIn October 1994, Eraserheads released a follow-up album entitled Circus. The band said that the album aptly described their life since their debut. The album was unpredictable and unconventional compared to the OPM ballads at that time, and established the band members as songwriters and musicians. The songs varied in style and mood, ranging from euphoric and hilarious to tender and somber. In the same year, Eraserheads played during the Miss Universe Pageant which was held in Manila.[citation needed]\nFour of the songs became successive hits: “Kailan” (When), “Magasin” (Magazine), “Alapaap” (High Clouds) and “With a Smile”. Circus turned gold in just 30 days with 20,000 copies sold. Eventually, it turned quintuple platinum with 200,000 copies sold. But like ultraelectromagneticpop!, it too had its share of controversy. In August 1995, Senator Tito Sotto, who was involved in an anti-drug campaign at that time, called for a ban on the airplay and sales of “Alapaap” over an alleged promotion of drug abuse in the lyrics of the song. In response, Eraserheads denied the allegation, saying that it was just a misinterpretation, and that the song was the band’s “ode to freedom”, not an “ode to drug abuse”. One interesting innovation of Circus album is Track 16, “Prof. Banlaoi’s Transcendental Medication After Every Six Months Or Punk Zappa Three” composed by Marcus. It’s a filler track named after Adoro’s friend and dorm-mate, Prof. Rommel Banlaoi, a political science teacher and a security studies expert. Adoro and Banlaoi, along with Zabala and Marasigan, belong to the University of the Philippines Diliman Batch 88.\nThe group’s third studio album Cutterpillow, was launched an open-air concert attended by fans and followers. With Christmas barely a month over, Eraserheads opened 1996 by making history in the Philippine music scene once more. Cutterpillow turned gold, even before it hit the record stores, as a result of the pre-selling promo campaign. Soon, the band shot the music video for the song “Ang Huling El Bimbo” (The Last El Bimbo) from the album.\nLater that year, the band came up with a conceptual Christmas album Fruitcake. The album is notable in that it is the first and only album of the band recorded entirely in English. This was shortly followed by a release of a companion storybook of the same title.\nAlso in 1995 the band was given a shot at acting when they co-starred with comedian Joey De Leon of “Eat Bulaga” in the comedy film Run Barbi Run produced by GMA Network’s Cinemax Studios (now GMA Films).\n1997–2002: Later years and break-up Going International The year 1998 was marked with a series of gigs outside of the Philippines. Eraserheads' first-ever overseas gig was at BMG Records' “Sentosa Pop Festival” in Singapore in March 1997. It was then followed by a mini U.S. tour in May. They played at the Palace in Hollywood on May 2, 1997. Then, four months later in September, they were at the Radio City Music Hall in New York to receive the coveted “Moon Man” trophy for winning the 1997 MTV Asia Viewer’s Choice Award, which made Eraserheads the first-ever Filipino artists to win the award.\nThe promotional CD versions of “Milk and Money”, “Hard to Believe” and “Andalusian Dog”, was recorded in Manila and mixed at the Electric Lady Studios, New York City in September 1997. Electric Lady Studios was built by the rock legend Jimi Hendrix. The tracks soon became a part of their fifth album, Sticker Happy, released a few days after the MTV Awards. A month later, they were back in Singapore for a series of shows and appearances for MTV Asia.\nIn February 1998, they represented the Philippines at the annual “Asia Live Dream ‘98” for NHK Broadcasting in Tokyo, Japan. Then in May, they embarked on another U.S. tour, taking them from Oakland to Los Angeles and to New York. The band toured the U.S. under the Happy Box production outfit, which was formed by brothers Haro De Guzman and Levan “Schizo” De Guzman and some other friends.\nAugust 1998 saw the release of the album Aloha Milkyway in the Asian region, and finally in the Philippines two months later. The album contains chart-topping songs that have been re-mastered, as well as five new songs.\nIn early 1999, they had sold-out shows in Hong Kong, Sydney, and Dubai. Their next album, Natin99, was released in May.\nBetween May and June 2000, they did another tour of America dubbed, “The Pop Machine Tour – USA2000”, playing in locations from New York to Chicago and to California. During their tours, they also had Noel Garcia of The Pin-Ups as an addition to their expanded line-up, who played guitars, keyboards and sometimes drums. After almost two years, the much-awaited studio album, Carbon Stereoxide, was released in March 2001, featuring the tracks, “Maskara”, “Playground”, “Hula” and “Palamig”.\nBreak-up After weeks of speculation, it was confirmed that the main songwriter and lead singer, Ely Buendia, had left the band in mid-March 2002 for “reasons unknown”. However, in subsequent interviews, Buendia pointed to business matters as the cause of the band’s break-up.\nIn PULP Magazine, Buendia’s wife and manager, Diane Ventura, claimed that the breakup started with a miscommunication between Buendia and the band’s roadie, the result being that Buendia and Ventura turned up late at a mall gig. This upset the roadie who snidely referred to the couple as “unprofessional”. Buendia’s band colleagues and crew at the gig gave Buendia “a cold shoulder”, related Ventura, being under the impression that Buendia had come late deliberately. The next day, Buendia brought the incident to the attention of the band’s management boss, Butch Dans, to which he allegedly reverted the blame to the roadie’s “unprofessionalism”. Dans, however, allegedly chose to consider the roadie’s account over Buendia’s without much deliberation. Dans allegedly quipped that Buendia and Ventura were “probably too high on drugs” to remember the gig’s schedule. Ventura stepped in to dispute the allegation and vehemently denied that she and Buendia were even told of the schedule. The other three Eraserheads also believed the roadie’s story, which disturbed Buendia because he felt betrayed by their longstanding friendship. Buendia later announced to his mates through SMS that he was quitting the group.\nIn another interview, Marasigan said he was eating in SM Megamall, a local shopping mall when he heard of the news. He said he was “semi-surprised” and wondered if Zabala already knew about it. Adoro told of the story now famous among Eraserheads fans about Buendia’s cryptic text message. He said Buendia stated in the text message that he had already “graduated.” Adoro quipped in the same interview that it was natural for Buendia to graduate first, since he was in batch ‘87 of their college (UP Diliman), while the rest were in batch ‘88.\nZabala confessed in an interview that disbanding had not been that far away from the members’ minds. He said that there were many occasions when they could have disbanded but did not.\nAdoro expressed the belief of some people that the band was getting too old, and that it was “selfish” for the band to continue, likely referring to comments about how it’s time for other bands, besides Eraserheads, to shine. The band made it clear, though, that Buendia’s departure from the band wasn’t in any way violent and that there was no shouting (sigawan) or any confrontation involved.\nThe three remaining Eraserheads decided to continue. Within a few weeks, the “new” Eheads debuted at Hard Rock Cafe in Makati City on April 19, featuring a female singer-guitarist, Kris Gorra-Dancel, from the band, Fatal Posporos. However, after a few months, Adoro had quit the band as well. The remaining members of the Eheads added Diego Mapa and Ebe Dancel to their lineup and renamed their band, “Cambio”.\n2003–2007: After the break-up Tribute albums Just a few years after the break-up, the tribute album Ultraelectromagneticjam!: The Music of the Eraserheads was released in honor of the band.\nMany questioned whether the time was right for a tribute to a group that had just disbanded four years ago, with its former members still active in the music industry. Buendia had mixed feelings about the tribute album, saying that “It’s too early to be taking part in it and I don’t see myself being part of it kasi (because) I’m still doing something here…To be part of it is like acknowledging na tapos na ako (that I am finished); isa na lang akong trophy na itatago na (I’m just a trophy to be shelved). Siguro kung uugud-ugud na ako (Maybe when I’m really old), that’s the time I’m gonna look back.” Ironically though, he does guest vocals in one of the tracks, “Superproxy 2k6” by the late Master Rapper Francis M.\nOn May 9, 2012, Star Records and Star Cinema released The Reunion: An Eraserheads Tribute Album, a tribute album of their own that accompanies the film The Reunion.\nMini-reunions On February 28, 2007, the official launch of the book Tikman ang Langit: An Anthology on the Eraserheads (2007) was held at the second level of Powerbooks bookstore in Greenbelt 3, Makati City. The launch was accompanied by acoustic performances by Cambio (whose members include Raimund Marasigan, Buddy Zabala and Kris Gorra-Dancel), Markus Highway (Marcus Adoro’s band), and Lei Bautista of Prettier Than Pink. The performers covered Eraserheads songs such as “Ligaya” (performed by Lei Bautista), “With a Smile” (also performed by Bautista) and “Magasin” (performed by Cambio with Marcus Adoro). The event was dubbed a mini-reunion of Eraserheads, with Marasigan, Zabala and Adoro performing together for the first time in four years. Buendia did not attend because of a scheduled meeting with his surgeon and the manufacturers of the stents in his heart.\nTikman ang Langit is a collection of essays about Eraserheads written by fourteen journalists who are mostly fans of the band. The book itself was compiled by Melvin Calimag and Jing Garcia, with a foreword by Eraserheads producer Robin Rivera.\nAnother mini-reunion happened in Saguijo on July 26, 2007. Visitors were startled as the venue’s schedule listed “Eraserheads” as a performer along with Rivermaya and Teeth. Jugs Jugueta of Itchyworms and Kris Gorra-Dancel of Cambio played guitars, Zabala on bass, Marasigan on drums, Jett Pangan of The Dawn on vocals, and producer Robin Rivera played drums when Marasigan sang. They called themselves “Eraser X” during that night. Buendia and Adoro knew about the event but did not go there as they had other gigs as well. Pupil was in Hard Rock Cafe Makati, while Adoro had gigs with Markus Highway, although Pupil’s bassist Dok Sergio was able to follow and played for Teeth.\nAdoro, Zabala, and Marasigan did an impromptu number at the Millennia Club called “Marooned”, a production of UP bands from past and present. The song Batch 88 from “Belma en Luis”, was one of the songs that were jammed by the trio.[citation needed]\n2008–present: Reunion In July 2008, it was confirmed by the members that they will be reuniting for a one-off concert to be held on August 30, 2008. Ely Buendia did affirm that the reunion will be for a night’s performance only, to be sponsored by a multinational tobacco company. Buendia was quoted saying “I’m not doing this for the money but for the E-heads fans who remain loyal”. The sponsors are expecting 35,000 attendees with free tickets distributed to online registrants in early August 2008. This highly awaited one-night concert was initially reported to be planned for staging at the Cultural Center of the Philippines open grounds, or alternatively, the Fort Bonifacio open grounds.\nOn August 22, word had broken out that Philip Morris had pulled out of the concert and that the show had been “canceled”.\nAnti-Tobacco forces, led by Dr. Maricar Limpin, had been active in a campaign to get Eraserheads to renounce the concert and the involvement of the tobacco giant, as Alicia Keys had done in her recent concert in Indonesia. Eraserheads never issued such an announcement. However, it was believed that the pressure exerted by the anti-tobacco forces had caused Philip Morris to end their participation in the concert.\nOn the evening of August 24, Raimund Marasigan issued a response to this news. Posting on the Sandwich and Cambio mailing lists, Marasigan confirmed that while Philip Morris has pulled out of the production, the concert is “most definitely” pushing through on the original date, August 30, 2008, at the Fort Bonifacio open field.\nPhilip Morris would no longer be involved, but the entire production had been turned over to a new producer. Furthermore, while it was previously made known through Philip Morris’ announcement that the concert would be free to smokers who signed up through a promotional website known as The Red List at , the change in producers meant that tickets would no longer be free but made available to anyone who purchased them. It was later revealed that Radiohead Media Solutions, Inc., MTV Philippines, Fox International Channels Philippines, Smart Communications, Musiko Records, Greater East Asia Music \u0026 Sony BMG Music Entertainment (also known as Sony Music Philippines Inc. \u0026 BMG Rights Management) have taken over the event.\nEraserheads went onstage for their reunion concert on August 30, 2008, at The Fort Open Field, Taguig City. The concert, however, was cut short halfway through a planned 30-song setlist as Buendia was rushed to the Makati Medical Hospital after experiencing chest pains. He was reported to be in stable condition. Buddy Zabala had checked on Buendia in his tent right after they went to their planned 20-minute break and saw that he already was on an oxygen mask with paramedics checking his blood pressure. As he left and came back, paramedics were already taking Buendia on an ambulance. Bandmates Zabala, Marasigan and Adoro further said that they had no idea that Buendia was already having difficulty performing. In the spirit of the reunion, Marasigan, Zabala, and Adoro went to Saguijo after the concert and they continued their sets there. Kris Gorra-Dancel, Ebe Dancel, Aia De Leon, and many other OPM artists joined them as well. During the concert, Jazz Nicolas of the Itchyworms and a close friend of the band, also joined the band and played synths, keyboards, and other back-up instruments.\nMTV Philippines President Francis Lumen stated: “He had a slight attack because of stress due to the recent passing of his mother (Lisette Buendia), and their sound check which lasted till 3 a.m. today (Saturday).” Buendia’s mother died of cardiac arrest on August 28 after recovering from surgery to treat her intestinal cancer. Buendia was transferred to Philippine Heart Center 10:00 p.m. of August 31 after being treated at the critical care area of the Makati Medical Center emergency room. Sony BMG reported Buendia was “stable” after suffering hypokalemia a medical condition in which the concentration of potassium in the blood is low. Buendia had been administered with a potassium intravenous fluid.\nBuendia, 37, on September 1, 2008, underwent his third heart angioplasty surgery since his January, 2007 heart attack. The blood vessel operated upon was “100 percent fully restored,” and Buendia was recovering in “stable condition but still under observation.” On September 5, 2008, Buendia was discharged from the hospital.\nOn 25 October episode of Startalk, Buendia said that the reunion concert was supposed to be a “one night only” Eraserheads reunion concert. He also said that there are no talks yet for a continuation of the said concert. However, he stated that he indeed felt “bitin” (literally translated, “not satisfied”) with the uncompleted concert and is open to any sequels if it would have the proper production and venue. The other three members of the band, Adoro, Zabala, and Marasigan also expressed similar views in a follow-up interview by Myx and Inquirer.\nSony-BMG Philippines, Musiko Records \u0026 Greater East Asia Music released the concert movie of the band’s reunion concert on November 26, 2008.\nOn the January 10 edition of Supreme, a feature of The Philippine Star, it was announced that the continuation of their previous reunion concert would happen on March 7, 2009.\nOn January 11, this was confirmed by Marasigan through a message he posted on the Pedicab, Cambio, and Sandwich Mailing Lists.\nOn February 27, the band was awarded as “Myx Magna Award 2009” in the recent 4th Myx Music Awards 2009, achieving their alternative music excellence.\nThe band went on stage for their second reunion concert dubbed as The Final Set on March 7, 2009, at the SM Mall of Asia Concert Grounds, Pasay City were approximately 100,000 people attended the sold-out concert. The concert went ahead despite the recent passing of their guest performer and friend Francis Magalona who died of acute myelogenous leukemia noon of the previous day.\nWorld tours and other projects The band continued to perform on sporadic worldwide tours from 2012 to 2014. Eraserheads held another reunion concert in the United States (San Francisco, Los Angeles \u0026 New Jersey) and Canada (Toronto) from October 12 to 20, 2012.\nAfter their American Tour, the next show for the band was at the du Music Festival. Held at the Dubai Amphitheatre, U.A.E on April 4, 2013, the festival featured a diverse lineup of music stars including Guns N’ Roses, Train, Natalie Cole, Andrea Bocelli and other local acts. The band also featured a “fifth Eraserhead”, Rommel ‘Sancho’ Sanchez on additional guitar duties. Rommel joined the band, too, during their 2012 North American tour. During the Dubai concert, Ely dedicated the song “Lightyears” to the OFWs.\nAfter four months, on August 10, 2013, Eraserheads played a show in another country, Singapore. On December 27, 2013, Eraserheads and Parokya ni Edgar performed at “High Impact Asia” Meydan Racecourse, Al Meydan Road, Nad Al Sheba, Dubai, UAE.\nEraserheads performed their first major rock concert at the Eventim Apollo in London, England on April 4, 2014. This was produced by Marvin Guzman and Bernadith Marimon of Finest Workers UK Ltd in the US.\nIn September 2014, the band released two new songs via Esquire (Philippines edition), titled “1995” and “Sabado”. This was their first release of new material in more than a decade. The magazine cover mimics the Beatles’ Abbey Road cover, which was shot during the band’s tour in London.\nEraserheads guested in the rebranding launch event, “A New Day”, of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, along with its subsidiary Smart Communications. The band performed 5 encore songs and 13 main setlist songs.\nIn a tweet posted in January 2018, Buendia said: “Some people will never understand that people who don’t get along don’t work together.” The statement was interpreted by Philippine Daily Inquirer and some fans as a response to calls for another reunion concert in the band’s home country.\nA musical adaptation of Eraserheads' discography entitled Ang Huling El Bimbo ran from July 20 to September 2, 2018 at Resorts World Manila. A second run for the musical was set for March 2019. The band’s first album was set to be rereleased in its first time on vinyl format, in November 2019. In December 2020, the band released a special edition photobook that features photos taken from the Final Set concert in 2009. The three band members, Raimund, Buddy, and Marcus formed the band “Ultracombo” in 2019 and performed the songs of the Eraserheads. Marcus left the group on the following months after performing on a couple of gigs.\nMembers  Ely Buendia – lead vocals, rhythm guitar Buddy Zabala – bass guitar, backing vocals Marcus Adoro – lead guitar, backing vocals Raimund Marasigan – drums \u0026 percussion, backing vocals  Discography Main article: Eraserheads discography\nStudio albums  Ultraelectromagneticpop!

The paper was created to serve mainly the Americans who were sent to Manila to fight in the Spanish–American War. At the time, most of the newspapers in the Philippines were in Spanish and a few others were in the native languages. Shortly after the paper’s founding, reports reached Manila about the Paris Conference that would lead to the treaty ceding the Philippines to the United States from Spain.\nThe first issue of The Manila Times on October 11, 1898 had a sheet of two leaves, or four pages, measuring about 12 by 8 inches, each page divided into two columns. The first page was taken up by announcements and advertisements. Page 2 was the editorial page. It contained the editorials and the more important news of the day. Page 3 was devoted to cable news from Europe and the United States all bearing on the Spanish–American War.\n  In 1899, George Sellner acquired The Manila Times from Gowan, who joined the paper as business manager.\n  In 1902, an American businessman acquired The Manila Times, reacquired by Sellner in 1905.\n  In 1907, Thomas C.

His first name is often misspelled Raymond or Raimond though he personally prefers to spell his name as Raymund. The breadth of his projects has made him one of the most well-respected mainstays of the Philippine rock band scene. He was the drummer, vocalist and lyricist alongside bandmate Ely Buendia of the Eraserheads, and the current keyboard/synths player for Pedicab, former rhythm guitarist and now frontman of Sandwich, current drummer of Cambio, vocalist of Project 1 and the man behind Squid 9. Currently, he holds bass for his newest band, Gaijin. Aside from writing songs and being a musician, he is also a record producer, voice actor, TV host and product endorser.\nEraserheads He first achieved fame as drummer for the rock band Eraserheads, one of the most popular Philippine bands of the 1990s. He played the drums, provided backing vocals, and occasionally sang on lead vocals. Marasigan’s songwriting output for the Eraserheads was only next to that of its principal songwriter Ely Buendia.\nIn 2002, vocalist-guitarist Ely Buendia left the Eraserheads, and Kris Dancel from the all-female band Fatal Posporos was recruited to fill the vacancy. The group billed themselves as Eheads and issued an EP entitled Please Transpose (2003). The group later renamed themselves Cambio after their lead guitarist Marcus Adoro quit. Cambio released two albums: Derby Light (2003) and Matic (2007).\nOn August 30, 2008 at the Fort Bonifacio Open Grounds in Taguig, Marasigan joined Buendia, Adoro, and Zabala for The Eraserheads reunion concert. The continuation of the reunion “The Final Set” was held on March 7, 2009 at the SM Mall of Asia concert grounds.\nSandwich The band Sandwich was formed in 1995 with Myrene Academia (Imago) \u0026 (Duster) on bass, Marc Abaya on lead guitars and vocals later replaced by Mong Alcaraz of Chicosci on guitars when the former quit to focus on being an MTV mainstay, Diego Castillo on rhythm guitars, and Mike Dizon (of bands Pedicab and Teeth) on drums. Although existing simultaneously with the Eraserheads, Sandwich provided a heavier, grittier sound, and built up their own fan base. Marc Abaya left the band in 2005 to concentrate on his career as a VJ while frontlining for his other band Kjwan and Marasigan took over as the lead vocalist. They have released three albums: Grip Stand Throw and 4-Track Mind (later reissued as a 2-in-1 by Sony BMG, and 2004’s award-winning Thanks to the Moon’s Gravitational Pull (initially an indie release; then later reissued by EMI Philippines with bonus tracks. Sandwich released further albums, entitled Five on the Floor (2006) which featured the phenomenal hit single, Sugod, and S Marks the Spot (2008), with its hit single Procrastinator and Betamax.\nPedicab In early 2005, Marasigan once again formed Pedicab, another project band. Composed of seasoned artists donning alter egos; Raymund (a.k.a. Sugarraims) is on synths and backup vocals; Mike Dizon (of Sandwich and Teeth) a.k.a. Masterbeat is on drums; Jason Caballa (of Twisted Halo and Blast Ople) a.k.a. J. Sonic is on guitar and backup vocals; Diego Mapa (of Monsterbot and Cambio) a.k.a. Daddy Maps is lead vocals; and acclaimed music video director RA Rivera a.k.a. Just Toni is on visuals and multimedia. They call their music “dunk music” which is essentially their own version of Dance-punk. They released a two-track sampler called “For Hire” with tracks “Bago Pa Mag Pasko” and “Pa-Experience”. Pedicab’s first album Tugish Takish (the name coming from onomatopoeia of the sounds made by banging on drums) under Vicor music was released later that year. Tugish Takish has spawned hits such as “Dito Tayo Sa Dilim”, “Dizzy Boy”, “Konti Na Lang” and “A Stormy Night”. Their second album “Shinji Ilabas Mo Na Ang Helicopter” with carrier single “Ang Pusa Mo” was released in April 2008 under MCA Records Philippines. Their second album also contains the remake of “Pa-Experience” which they retitled to “Pa-Taste”. It also has fan favorites such as “FX”, “Follow Through”, and “Breaking Away”.\nProject 1 In 2008, Marasigan launched his new album with Sandwich, after that, he also launched a one-shot band called “Project 1” with Clem Castro (former Orange and Lemons, now The Camerawalls) on guitars, Francis Reyes (The Dawn) also on guitars, Carlos Calderon (Chicosci) on bass, Jazz Nicolas (Itchyworms) on drums and Uela Basco (Chilitees), Katwo Librando (Narda/Duster) and Marasigan himself on vocals. Their first single “Ang Sarap Dito” was released in March 2008. According to its members, “The new group was formed because we, as artists, feel that we wanted to create something fresh, especially for the young generation. We all believe in a common goal of being positive and changing the way young people think.” Their first and only single was used by Coca-Cola Philippines for television and radio commercials and also by Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus.\nOther projects Music Squid 9 Squid 9 is a hip-hop influenced band that started out as a studio act and is formed from members of the Eraserheads, Monsterbot and Sun Valley Crew among others. It was soon performing live shows as well. Squid 9 released three albums: “Deleted Scenes”, “Kraken Modular” and “Ink Jet”. Squid 9 is also part of Electronica Manila and often collaborated with the late Wolfmann+. Squid9 Live is composed of Marasigan on samplers, drum machine and Chaos Pad), Vin Dancel (Twisted Halo and Peryodiko) and Kathy Meneses (Daydreamcycle) on vocals, Buddy Zabala (The Eraserheads, The Dawn, Twisted Halo \u0026 Cambio) on bass, keyboards and samplers and Rann Golamco (Drip, Porta, and formerly of Mojofly) on guitars. Marasigan calls his home studio “The Squid Crib”.\nPlanet Garapata Marasigan started Planet Garapata also in 1996, a short-lived hip-hop and electronica project that featured Eraserheads bassist Buddy Zabala, Rivermaya drummer Mark Escueta and Eraserheads sound engineer Mark Laccay and Jeng Tan. The project debuted in Francis M.’s 1996 Happy Battle album and featured Marasigan’s early rapping skills.\nSun Valley Crew He is also part of Sun Valley Crew, a hip-hop/rap group with members Ryan Armamento and RJ Seneres on vocals, Uela Basco also on vocals, Mong Alcaraz on guitars, Dan Gil on Rhodes keyboards, Dex Aguila on Drums, Raimund Marasigan on samplers and Ryan Ventura on bass.\nOther collaborations He is often dubbed as “The Philippines' busiest musician”, with multiple but different, simultaneous bands, in addition to collaborations with various artists such as Francis Magalona, The Pin-Up Girls, Rivermaya, Keltscross, Sugarfree, Itchyworms, Chicosci, Freestyle, Wolfmann, The Dawn, Chillitees, and others.\nMarasigan collaborated with Radioactive Sago Project’s Lourd de Verya and they created the song “Egis, Er’p!” for a film about Philippine Science High School System, titled “Pisay”.

Gaijin means “foreigner” in Japanese. As the name implies, the group is composed of different artists from different heritages. Marasigan is Filipino, Grinter is American, and Tanaka is Japanese. Given the multi-national status of the band, their music is also focused towards the international music scene.\nHe was chosen by ABS-CBN, together with Rico Blanco and Aia de Leon, for the theme song of the network’s 2010 elections campaign, which calls on Filipinos, especially the youth, to register, vote, and make the 2010 elections work. It also features the “Boto Mo, iPatrol Mo” drumbeat.\nIn 2014 he collaborate with rap prince Abra for Sanib Puwersa (Joined Forces) for beer brand Colt 45, the main competitor of Red Horse Beer which was endorsed by former bandmante Ely Buendia and Joey Pepe Smith.\nMarasigan also launched Assembly Generals in 2015, which is dubbed as “Raw Electric Filipino Hiphop”, with members Paolo Toledo, Mon Punzalan, and Deng Garcia.

The purpose of the holiday is to give thanks to the ocean’s bounty and to consider the importance of the ocean to Japan as an island nation.\nMany people take advantage of the holiday and summer weather to take a beach trip. Other ocean-related festivities are observed as well. The date roughly coincides with the end of the rainy season (梅雨 tsuyu) in much of the Japan mainland.\nIn 2020, the holiday was observed on Thursday, July 23, a one-time move that was made as a special accommodation to support the opening of the Tokyo Olympics. Due to the postponement of the Olympics, the 2021 date will be moved to July 22, also on Thursday as a one-time holiday.\nHistory The day was known as Marine Memorial Day (海の記念日, umi no kinen bi) until 1996. Communications Minister Shozo Murata designated the day in 1941 to commemorate the Meiji Emperor and his 1876 voyage in the Meiji Maru, an iron steamship constructed in Scotland in 1874. The voyage included a trip around the Tōhoku region, embarking on a lighthouse boat in Aomori, and a brief stop in Hakodate before returning to Yokohama on July 20 of that year. However, it was not designated a national holiday until 1995, when it became the first holiday in the summer months.\nFirst observed on July 20, 1996, the Happy Monday System legislation moved the date to the third Monday of July beginning in 2003.\nAs special arrangement for the 2020 Summer Olympics, the 2020 date for Marine Day was moved to July 23. With the Olympics and Paralympics postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government left this change in place for 2020 and passed an amendment to the Olympic and Paralympic Special Measures Act to make a corresponding change to the holiday in 2021. Celebration\nOn this day, families may visit the sea and swim, snorkel, surf, or dive. People may also participate in an event called ‘mud-ball throwing’. Mud-balls are composed of “Effective Micro-organisms” (EMs), which help break-down and eliminate sea grime. National aquariums also host special water-related events on this day.\nAdapted from Wikipedia, under Creative Commons license.\n","categories":"","description":"Japanese holiday","excerpt":"Japanese holiday","ref":"/wiki/marine-day-umi-no-hi/","tags":"","title":"Marine Day (Umi no Hi)"},{"body":"Translated into English from the original Spanish\nPublished by Philippine Education Company\nNew York: World Book Company\n1912\nCopyright, 1912, by Philippine Education Company.\nEntered at Stationers’ Hall.\nRegistrado en las Islas Filipinas.\nAll rights reserved.\n Translator’s Introduction I  We travel rapidly in these historical sketches. The reader flies in his express train in a few minutes through a couple of centuries. The centuries pass more slowly to those to whom the years are doled out day by day. Institutions grow and beneficently develop themselves, making their way into the hearts of generations which are shorter-lived than they, attracting love and respect, and winning loyal obedience; and then as gradually forfeiting by their shortcomings the allegiance which had been honorably gained in worthier periods. We see wealth and greatness; we see corruption and vice; and one seems to follow so close upon the other, that we fancy they must have always co-existed. We look more steadily, and we perceive long periods of time, in which there is first a growth and then a decay, like what we perceive in a tree of the forest.\nFROUDE, Annals of an English Abbey\n Monasticism’s record in the Philippines presents no new general fact to the eye of history. The attempt to eliminate the eternal feminine from her natural and normal sphere in the scheme of things there met with the same certain and signal disaster that awaits every perversion of human activity. Beginning with a band of zealous, earnest men, sincere in their convictions, to whom the cause was all and their personalities nothing, it there, as elsewhere, passed through its usual cycle of usefulness, stagnation, corruption, and degeneration.\nTo the unselfish and heroic efforts of the early friars Spain in large measure owed her dominion over the Philippine Islands and the Filipinos a marked advance on the road to civilization and nationality. In fact, after the dreams of sudden wealth from gold and spices had faded, the islands were retained chiefly as a missionary conquest and a stepping-stone to the broader fields of Asia, with Manila as a depot for the Oriental trade. The records of those early years are filled with tales of courage and heroism worthy of Spain’s proudest years, as the missionary fathers labored with unflagging zeal in disinterested endeavor for the spread of the Faith and the betterment of the condition of the Malays among whom they found themselves. They won the confidence of the native peoples, gathered them into settlements and villages, led them into the ways of peace, and became their protectors, guides, and counselors.\nIn those times the cross and the sword went hand in hand, but in the Philippines the latter was rarely needed or used. The lightness and vivacity of the Spanish character, with its strain of Orientalism, its fertility of resource in meeting new conditions, its adaptability in dealing with the dwellers in warmer lands, all played their part in this as in the other conquests. Only on occasions when some stubborn resistance was met with, as in Manila and the surrounding country, where the most advanced of the native peoples dwelt and where some of the forms and beliefs of Islam had been established, was it necessary to resort to violence to destroy the native leaders and replace them with the missionary fathers. A few sallies by young Salcedo, the Cortez of the Philippine conquest, with a company of the splendid infantry, which was at that time the admiration and despair of martial Europe, soon effectively exorcised any idea of resistance that even the boldest and most intransigent of the native leaders might have entertained.\nFor the most part, no great persuasion was needed to turn a simple, imaginative, fatalistic people from a few vague animistic deities to the systematic iconology and the elaborate ritual of the Spanish Church. An obscure Bathala or a dim Malyari was easily superseded by or transformed into a clearly defined Diós, and in the case of any especially tenacious “demon,” he could without much difficulty be merged into a Christian saint or devil. There was no organized priesthood to be overcome, the primitive religious observances consisting almost entirely of occasional orgies presided over by an old woman, who filled the priestly offices of interpreter for the unseen powers and chief eater at the sacrificial feast. With their unflagging zeal, their organization, their elaborate forms and ceremonies, the missionaries were enabled to win the confidence of the natives, especially as the greater part of them learned the local language and identified their lives with the communities under their care. Accordingly, the people took kindly to their new teachers and rulers, so that in less than a generation Spanish authority was generally recognized in the settled portions of the Philippines, and in the succeeding years the missionaries gradually extended this area by forming settlements from among the wilder peoples, whom they persuaded to abandon the more objectionable features of their old roving, often predatory, life and to group themselves into towns and villages “under the bell.”\nThe tactics employed in the conquest and the subsequent behavior of the conquerors were true to the old Spanish nature, so succinctly characterized by a plain-spoken Englishman of Mary’s reign, when the war-cry of Castile encircled the globe and even hovered ominously near the “sceptered isle,” when in the intoxication of power character stands out so sharply defined: “They be verye wyse and politicke, and can, thorowe ther wysdome, reform and brydell theyr owne natures for a tyme, and applye ther conditions to the manners of those men with whom they meddell gladlye by friendshippe; whose mischievous maners a man shall never know untyll he come under ther subjection; but then shall he parfectlye parceve and fele them: for in dissimulations untyll they have ther purposes, and afterwards in oppression and tyrannye, when they can obtain them, they do exceed all other nations upon the earthe.” [1]\nIn the working out of this spirit, with all the indomitable courage and fanatical ardor derived from the long contests with the Moors, they reduced the native peoples to submission, but still not to the galling yoke which they fastened upon the aborigines of America, to make one Las Casas shine amid the horde of Pizarros. There was some compulsory labor in timber-cutting and ship-building, with enforced military service as rowers and soldiers for expeditions to the Moluccas and the coasts of Asia, but nowhere the unspeakable atrocities which in Mexico, Hispaniola, and South America drove mothers to strangle their babes at birth and whole tribes to prefer self-immolation to the living death in the mines and slave-pens. Quite differently from the case in America, where entire islands and districts were depopulated, to bring on later the curse of negro slavery, in the Philippines the fact appears that the native population really increased and the standard of living was raised under the stern, yet beneficent, tutelage of the missionary fathers. The great distance and the hardships of the journey precluded the coming of many irresponsible adventurers from Spain and, fortunately for the native population, no great mineral wealth was ever discovered in the Philippine Islands.\nThe system of government was, in its essential features, a simple one. The missionary priests drew the inhabitants of the towns and villages about themselves or formed new settlements, and with profuse use of symbol and symbolism taught the people the Faith, laying particular stress upon “the fear of God,” as administered by them, reconciling the people to their subjection by inculcating the Christian virtues of patience and humility. When any recalcitrants refused to accept the new order, or later showed an inclination to break away from it, the military forces, acting usually under secret directions from the padre, made raids in the disaffected parts with all the unpitying atrocity the Spanish soldiery were ever capable of displaying in their dealings with a weaker people. After sufficient punishment had been inflicted and a wholesome fear inspired, the padre very opportunely interfered in the natives’ behalf, by which means they were convinced that peace and security lay in submission to the authorities, especially to the curate of their town or district. A single example will suffice to make the method clear: not an isolated instance but a typical case chosen from among the mass of records left by the chief actors themselves.\nFray Domingo Perez, evidently a man of courage and conviction, for he later lost his life in the work of which he wrote, was the Dominican vicar on the Zambales coast when that Order temporarily took over the district from the Recollects. In a report written for his superior in 1680 he outlines the method clearly: “In order that those whom we have assembled in the three villages may persevere in their settlements, the most efficacious fear and the one most suited to their nature is that the Spaniards of the fort and presidio of Paynaven[2] of whom they have a very great fear, may come very often to the said villages and overrun the land, and penetrate even into their old recesses where they formerly lived; and if perchance they should find anything planted in the said recesses that they would destroy it and cut it down without leaving them anything. And so that they may see the father protects them, when the said Spaniards come to the village, the father opposes them and takes the part of the Indians. But it is always necessary in this matter for the soldiers to conquer, and the father is always very careful always to inform the Spaniards by whom and where anything is planted which it may be necessary to destroy, and that the edicts which his Lordship, the governor, sent them be carried out …. But at all events said Spaniards are to make no trouble for the Indians whom they find in the villages, but rather must treat them well.”[3]\nThis in 1680: the Dominican transcriber of the record in 1906 has added a very illuminating note, revealing the immutability of the system and showing that the rulers possessed in a superlative degree the Bourbonesque trait of learning nothing and forgetting nothing: “Even when I was a missionary to the heathens from 1882 to 1892, I had occasion to observe the said policy, to inform the chief of the fortress of the measures that he ought to take, and to make a false show on the other side so that it might have no influence on the fortress.”\nThus it stands out in bold relief as a system built up and maintained by fraud and force, bound in the course of nature to last only as long as the deception could be carried on and the repressive force kept up to sufficient strength. Its maintenance required that the different sections be isolated from each other so that there could be no growth toward a common understanding and coöperation, and its permanence depended upon keeping the people ignorant and contented with their lot, held under strict control by religious and political fear.\nYet it was a vast improvement over their old mode of life [x]and their condition was bettered as they grew up to such a system. Only with the passing of the years and the increase of wealth and influence, the ease and luxury invited by these, and the consequent corruption so induced, with the insatiable longing ever for more wealth and greater influence, did the poison of greed and grasping power enter the system to work its insidious way into every part, slowly transforming the beneficent institution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries into an incubus weighing upon all the activities of the people in the nineteenth, an unyielding bar to the development of the country, a hideous anachronism in these modern times.\nIt must be remembered also that Spain, in the years following her brilliant conquests of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, lost strength and vigor through the corruption at home induced by the unearned wealth that flowed into the mother country from the colonies, and by the draining away of her best blood. Nor did her sons ever develop that economic spirit which is the permanent foundation of all empire, but they let the wealth of the Indies flow through their country, principally to London and Amsterdam, there to form in more practical hands the basis of the British and Dutch colonial empires.\nThe priest and the soldier were supreme, so her best sons took up either the cross or the sword to maintain her dominion in the distant colonies, a movement which, long continued, spelled for her a form of national suicide. The soldier expended his strength and generally laid down his life on alien soil, leaving no fit successor of his own stock to carry on the work according to his standards. The priest under the celibate system, in its better days left no offspring at all and in the days of its corruption none bred and reared under the influences that make for social and political progress. The dark chambers of the Inquisition stifled all advance in thought, so the civilization and the culture of Spain, as well as her political system, settled into rigid forms to await only the inevitable process of stagnation and decay. In her proudest hour an old soldier, who had lost one of his hands fighting her battles against the Turk at Lepanto, employed the other in writing the masterpiece of her literature, which is really a caricature of the nation.\nThere is much in the career of Spain that calls to mind the dazzling beauty of her “dark-glancing daughters,” with its early bloom, its startling—almost morbid—brilliance, and its premature decay. Rapid and brilliant was her rise, gradual and inglorious her steady decline, from the bright morning when the banners of Castile and Aragon were flung triumphantly from the battlements of the Alhambra, to the short summer, not so long gone, when at Cavite and Santiago with swift, decisive havoc the last ragged remnants of the once world-dominating power were blown into space and time, to hover disembodied there, a lesson and a warning to future generations. Whatever her final place in the records of mankind, whether as the pioneer of modern civilization or the buccaneer of the nations or, as would seem most likely, a goodly mixture of both, she has at least—with the exception only of her great mother, Rome—furnished the most instructive lessons in political pathology yet recorded, and the advice to students of world progress to familiarize themselves with her history is even more apt today than when it first issued from the encyclopedic mind of Macaulay nearly a century ago. Hardly had she reached the zenith of her power when the disintegration began, and one by one her brilliant conquests dropped away, to leave her alone in her faded splendor, with naught but her vaunting pride left, another “Niobe of nations.” In the countries more in contact with the trend of civilization and more susceptible to revolutionary influences from the mother country this separation came from within, while in the remoter parts the archaic and outgrown system dragged along until a stronger force from without destroyed it.\nNowhere was the crystallization of form and principle more pronounced than in religious life, which fastened upon the mother country a deadening weight that hampered all progress, and in the colonies, notably in the Philippines, virtually converted her government into a hagiarchy that had its face toward the past and either could not or would not move with the current of the times. So, when “the shot heard round the world,” the declaration of humanity’s right to be and to become, in its all-encircling sweep, reached the lands controlled by her it was coldly received and blindly rejected by the governing powers, and there was left only the slower, subtler, but none the less sure, process of working its way among the people to burst in time in rebellion and the destruction of the conservative forces that would repress it.\nIn the opening years of the nineteenth century the friar orders in the Philippines had reached the apogee of their power and usefulness. Their influence was everywhere felt and acknowledged, while the country still prospered under the effects of the vigorous and progressive administrations of Anda and Vargas in the preceding century. Native levies had fought loyally under Spanish leadership against Dutch and British invaders, or in suppressing local revolts among their own people, which were always due to some specific grievance, never directed definitely against the Spanish sovereignty. The Philippines were shut off from contact with any country but Spain, and even this communication was restricted and carefully guarded. There was an elaborate central government which, however, hardly touched the life of the native peoples, who were guided and governed by the parish priests, each town being in a way an independent entity.\nOf this halcyon period, just before the process of disintegration began, there has fortunately been left a record which may be characterized as the most notable Spanish literary production relating to the Philippines, being the calm, sympathetic, judicial account of one who had spent his manhood in the work there and who, full of years and experience, sat down to tell the story of their life.[4] In it there are no puerile whinings, no querulous curses that tropical Malays do not order their lives as did the people of the Spanish village where he may have been reared, no selfish laments of ingratitude over blessings unasked and only imperfectly understood by the natives, no fatuous self-deception as to the real conditions, but a patient consideration of the difficulties encountered, the good accomplished, and the unavoidable evils incident to any human work. The country and the people, too, are described with the charming simplicity of the eyes that see clearly, the brain that ponders deeply, and the heart that beats sympathetically. Through all the pages of his account runs the quiet strain of peace and contentment, of satisfaction with the existing order, for he had looked upon the creation and saw that it was good. There is “neither haste, nor hate, nor anger,” but the deliberate recital of the facts warmed and illumined by the geniality of a soul to whom age and experience had brought, not a sour cynicism, but the mellowing influence of a ripened philosophy. He was such an old man as may fondly be imagined walking through the streets of Parañaque in stately benignity amid the fear and respect of the brown people over whom he watched.\nBut in all his chronicle there is no suggestion of anything more to hope for, anything beyond. Beautiful as the picture is, it is that of a system which had reached maturity: a condition of stagnation, not of growth. In less than a decade, the terrific convulsions in European politics made themselves felt even in the remote Philippines, and then began the gradual drawing away of the people from their rulers—blind gropings and erratic wanderings at first, but nevertheless persistent and vigorous tendencies.\nThe first notable influence was the admission of representatives for the Philippines into the Spanish Cortes under the revolutionary governments and the abolition of the trade monopoly with Mexico. The last galleon reached Manila in 1815, and soon foreign commercial interests were permitted, in a restricted way, to enter the country. Then with the separation of Mexico and the other American colonies from Spain a more marked change was brought about in that direct communication was established with the mother country, and the absolutism of the hagiarchy first questioned by the numbers of Peninsular Spaniards who entered the islands to trade, some even to settle and rear families there. These also affected the native population in the larger centers by the spread of their ideas, which were not always in conformity with those that for several centuries the friars had been inculcating into their wards. Moreover, there was a not-inconsiderable portion of the population, sprung from the friars themselves, who were eager to adopt the customs and ideas of the Spanish immigrants.\nThe suppression of many of the monasteries in Spain in 1835 caused a large influx of the disestablished monks into the Philippines in search for a haven, and a home, thus bringing about a conflict with the native clergy, who were displaced from their best holdings to provide berths for the newcomers. At the same time, the increase of education among the native priests brought the natural demand for more equitable treatment by the Spanish friar, so insistent that it even broke out into open rebellion in 1843 on the part of a young Tagalog who thought himself aggrieved in this respect.\nThus the struggle went on, with stagnation above and some growth below, so that the governors were ever getting further away from the governed, and for such a movement there is in the course of nature but one inevitable result, especially when outside influences are actively at work penetrating the social system and making for better things. Among these influences four cumulative ones may be noted: the spread of journalism, the introduction of steamships into the Philippines, the return of the Jesuits, and the opening of the Suez Canal.\nThe printing-press entered the islands with the conquest, but its use had been strictly confined to religious works until about the middle of the past century, when there was a sudden awakening and within a few years five journals were being published. In 1848 appeared the first regular newspaper of importance, El Diario de Manila, and about a decade later the principal organ of the Spanish-Filipino population, El Comercio, which, with varying vicissitudes, has continued down to the present. While rigorously censored, both politically and religiously, and accessible to only an infinitesimal portion of the people, they still performed the service of letting a few rays of light into the Cimmerian intellectual gloom of the time and place.\nWith the coming of steam navigation communication between the different parts of the islands was facilitated and trade encouraged, with all that such a change meant in the way of breaking up the old isolation and tending to a common understanding. Spanish power, too, was for the moment more firmly established, and Moro piracy in Luzon and the Bisayan Islands, which had been so great a drawback to the development of the country, was forever ended.\nThe return of the Jesuits produced two general results tending to dissatisfaction with the existing order. To them was assigned the missionary field of Mindanao, which meant the displacement of the Recollect Fathers in the missions there, and for these other berths had to be found. Again the native clergy were the losers in that they had to give up their best parishes in Luzon, especially around Manila and Cavite, so the breach was further widened and the soil sown with discontent. But more far-reaching than this immediate result was the educational movement inaugurated by the Jesuits. The native, already feeling the vague impulses from without and stirred by the growing restlessness of the times, here saw a new world open before him. A considerable portion of the native population in the larger centers, who had shared in the economic progress of the colony, were enabled to look beyond their daily needs and to afford their children an opportunity for study and advancement—a condition and a need met by the Jesuits for a time.\nWith the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 communication with the mother country became cheaper, quicker, surer, so that large numbers of Spaniards, many of them in sympathy with the republican movements at home, came to the Philippines in search of fortunes and generally left half-caste families who had imbibed their ideas. Native boys who had already felt the intoxication of such learning as the schools of Manila afforded them began to dream of greater wonders in Spain, now that the journey was possible for them. So began the definite movements that led directly to the disintegration of the friar régime.\nIn the same year occurred the revolution in the mother country, which had tired of the old corrupt despotism. Isabella II was driven into exile and the country left to waver about uncertainly for several years, passing through all the stages of government from red radicalism to absolute conservatism, finally adjusting itself to the middle course of constitutional monarchism. During the effervescent and ephemeral republic there was sent to the Philippines a governor who set to work to modify the old system and establish a government more in harmony with modern ideas and more democratic in form. His changes were hailed with delight by the growing class of Filipinos who were striving for more consideration in their own country, and who, in their enthusiasm and the intoxication of the moment, perhaps became more radical than was safe under the conditions—surely too radical for their religious guides watching and waiting behind the veil of the temple.\nIn January, 1872, an uprising occurred in the naval arsenal at Cavite, with a Spanish non-commissioned officer as one of the leaders. From the meager evidence now obtainable, this would seem to have been purely a local mutiny over the service questions of pay and treatment, but in it the friars saw their opportunity. It was blazoned forth, with all the wild panic that was to characterize the actions of the governing powers from that time on, as the premature outbreak of a general insurrection under the leadership of the native clergy, and rigorous repressive measures were demanded. Three native priests, notable for their popularity among their own people, one an octogenarian and the other two young canons of the Manila Cathedral, were summarily garroted, along with the renegade Spanish officer who had participated in the mutiny. No record of any trial of these priests has ever been brought to light. The Archbishop, himself a secular[5] clergyman, stoutly refused to degrade them from their holy office, and they wore their sacerdotal robes at the execution, which was conducted in a hurried, fearful manner. At the same time a number of young Manilans who had taken conspicuous part in the “liberal” demonstrations were deported to the Ladrone Islands or to remote islands of the Philippine group itself.\nThis was the beginning of the end. Yet there immediately followed the delusive calm which ever precedes the fatal outburst, lulling those marked for destruction to a delusive security. The two decades following were years of quiet, unobtrusive growth, during which the Philippine Islands made the greatest economic progress in their history. But this in itself was preparing the final catastrophe, for if there be any fact well established in human experience it is that with economic development the power of organized religion begins to wane—the rise of the merchant spells the decline of the priest. A sordid change, from masses and mysteries to sugar and shoes, this is often said to be, but it should be noted that the epochs of greatest economic activity have been those during which the generality of mankind have lived fuller and freer lives, and above all that in such eras the finest intellects and the grandest souls have been developed.\nNor does an institution that has been slowly growing for three centuries, molding the very life and fiber of the people, disintegrate without a violent struggle, either in its own constitution or in the life of the people trained under it. Not only the ecclesiastical but also the social and political system of the country was controlled by the religious orders, often silently and secretly, but none the less effectively. This is evident from the ceaseless conflict that went on between the religious orders and the Spanish political administrators, who were at every turn thwarted in their efforts to keep the government abreast of the times.\nThe shock of the affair of 1872 had apparently stunned the Filipinos, but it had at the same time brought them to the parting of the ways and induced a vague feeling that there was something radically wrong, which could only be righted by a closer union among themselves. They began to consider that their interests and those of the governing powers were not the same. In these feelings of distrust toward the friars they were stimulated by the great numbers of immigrant Spaniards who were then entering the country, many of whom had taken part in the republican movements at home and who, upon the restoration of the monarchy, no doubt thought it safer for them to be at as great a distance as possible from the throne. The young Filipinos studying in Spain came from different parts of the islands, and by their association there in a foreign land were learning to forget their narrow sectionalism; hence the way was being prepared for some concerted action. Thus, aided and encouraged by the anti-clerical Spaniards in the mother country, there was growing up a new generation of native leaders, who looked toward something better than the old system.\nIt is with this period in the history of the country—the author’s boyhood—that the story of Noli Me Tangere deals. Typical scenes and characters are sketched from life with wonderful accuracy, and the picture presented is that of a master-mind, who knew and loved his subject. Terror and repression were the order of the day, with ever a growing unrest in the higher circles, while the native population at large seemed to be completely cowed—“brutalized” is the term repeatedly used by Rizal in his political essays. Spanish writers of the period, observing only the superficial movements,—some of which were indeed fantastical enough, for\n they,\nWho in oppression’s darkness caved have dwelt,\nThey are not eagles, nourished with the day;\nWhat marvel, then, at times, if they mistake their way?\n —and not heeding the currents at work below, take great delight in ridiculing the pretensions of the young men seeking advancement, while they indulge in coarse ribaldry over the wretched condition of the great mass of the “Indians.” The author, however, himself a “miserable Indian,” vividly depicts the unnatural conditions and dominant characters produced under the outworn system of fraud and force, at the same time presenting his people as living, feeling, struggling individuals, with all the frailties of human nature and all the possibilities of mankind, either for good or evil; incidentally he throws into marked contrast the despicable depreciation used by the Spanish writers in referring to the Filipinos, making clear the application of the self-evident proposition that no ordinary human being in the presence of superior force can very well conduct himself as a man unless he be treated as such.\nThe friar orders, deluded by their transient triumph and secure in their pride of place, became more arrogant, more domineering than ever. In the general administration the political rulers were at every turn thwarted, their best efforts frustrated, and if they ventured too far their own security threatened; for in the three-cornered wrangle which lasted throughout the whole of the Spanish domination, the friar orders had, in addition to the strength derived from their organization and their wealth, the Damoclean weapon of control over the natives to hang above the heads of both governor and archbishop. The curates in the towns, always the real rulers, became veritable despots, so that no voice dared to raise itself against them, even in the midst of conditions which the humblest indio was beginning to feel dumbly to be perverted and unnatural, and that, too, after three centuries of training under the system that he had ever been taught to accept as “the will of God.”\nThe friars seemed long since to have forgotten those noble aims that had meant so much to the founders and early workers of their orders, if indeed the great majority of those of the later day had ever realized the meaning of their office, for the Spanish writers of the time delight in characterizing them as the meanest of the Spanish peasantry, when not something worse, who had been “lassoed,” taught a few ritualistic prayers, and shipped to the Philippines to be placed in isolated towns as lords and masters of the native population, with all the power and prestige over a docile people that the sacredness of their holy office gave them. These writers treat the matter lightly, seeing in it rather a huge joke on the “miserable Indians,” and give the friars great credit for “patriotism,” a term which in this connection they dragged from depth to depth until it quite aptly fitted Dr. Johnson’s famous definition, “the last refuge of a scoundrel.”\nIn their conduct the religious corporations, both as societies and as individuals, must be estimated according to their own standards—the application of any other criterion would be palpably unfair. They undertook to hold the native in subjection, to regulate the essential activities of his life according to their ideas, so upon them must fall the responsibility for the conditions finally attained: to destroy the freedom of the subject and then attempt to blame him for his conduct is a paradox into which the learned men often fell, perhaps inadvertently through their deductive logic. They endeavored to shape the lives of their Malay wards not only in this existence but also in the next. Their vows were poverty, chastity, and obedience.\nThe vow of poverty was early relegated to the limbo of neglect. Only a few years after the founding of Manila royal decrees began to issue on the subject of complaints received by the King over the usurpation of lands on the part of the priests. Using the same methods so familiar in the heyday of the institution of monasticism in Europe—pious gifts, deathbed bequests, pilgrims’ offerings—the friar orders gradually secured the richest of the arable lands in the more thickly settled portions of the Philippines, notably the part of Luzon occupied by the Tagalogs. Not always, however, it must in justice be recorded, were such doubtful means resorted to, for there were instances where the missionary was the pioneer, gathering about himself a band of devoted natives and plunging into the unsettled parts to build up a town with its fields around it, which would later become a friar estate. With the accumulated incomes from these estates and the fees for religious observances that poured into their treasuries, the orders in their nature of perpetual corporations became the masters of the situation, the lords of the country. But this condition was not altogether objectionable; it was in the excess of their greed that they went astray, for the native peoples had been living under this system through generations and not until they began to feel that they were not receiving fair treatment did they question the authority of a power which not only secured them a peaceful existence in this life but also assured them eternal felicity in the next.\nWith only the shining exceptions that are produced in any system, no matter how false its premises or how decadent it may become, to uphold faith in the intrinsic soundness of human nature, the vow of chastity was never much more than a myth. Through the tremendous influence exerted over a fanatically religious people, who implicitly followed the teachings of the reverend fathers, once their confidence had been secured, the curate was seldom to be gainsaid in his desires. By means of the secret influence in the confessional and the more open political power wielded by him, the fairest was his to command, and the favored one and her people looked upon the choice more as an honor than otherwise, for besides the social standing that it gave her there was the proud prospect of becoming the mother of children who could claim kinship with the dominant race. The curate’s “companion” or the sacristan’s wife was a power in the community, her family was raised to a place of importance and influence among their own people, while she and her ecclesiastical offspring were well cared for. On the death or removal of the curate, it was almost invariably found that she had been provided with a husband or protector and a not inconsiderable amount of property—an arrangement rather appealing to a people among whom the means of living have ever been so insecure.\nThat this practise was not particularly offensive to the people among whom they dwelt may explain the situation, but to claim that it excuses the friars approaches dangerously close to casuistry. Still, as long as this arrangement was decently and moderately carried out, there seems to have been no great objection, nor from a worldly point of view, with all the conditions considered, could there be much. But the old story of excess, of unbridled power turned toward bad ends, again recurs, at the same time that the ideas brought in by the Spaniards who came each year in increasing numbers and the principles observed by the young men studying in Europe cast doubt upon the fitness of such a state of affairs. As they approached their downfall, like all mankind, the friars became more open, more insolent, more shameless, in their conduct.\nThe story of Maria Clara, as told in Noli Me Tangere, is by no means an exaggerated instance, but rather one of the few clean enough to bear the light, and her fate, as depicted in the epilogue, is said to be based upon an actual occurrence with which the author must have been familiar.\nThe vow of obedience—whether considered as to the Pope, their highest religious authority, or to the King of Spain, their political liege—might not always be so callously disregarded, but it could be evaded and defied. From the Vatican came bull after bull, from the Escorial decree after decree, only to be archived in Manila, sometimes after a hollow pretense of compliance. A large part of the records of Spanish domination is taken up with the wearisome quarrels that went on between the Archbishop, representing the head of the Church, and the friar orders, over the questions of the episcopal visitation and the enforcement of the provisions of the Council of Trent relegating the monks to their original status of missionaries, with the friars invariably victorious in their contentions. Royal decrees ordering inquiries into the titles to the estates of the men of poverty and those providing for the education of the natives in Spanish were merely sneered at and left to molder in harmless quiet. Not without good grounds for his contention, the friar claimed that the Spanish dominion over the Philippines depended upon him, and he therefore confidently set himself up as the best judge of how that dominion should be maintained.\nThus there are presented in the Philippines of the closing quarter of the century just past the phenomena so frequently met with in modern societies, so disheartening to the people who must drag out their lives under them, of an old system which has outworn its usefulness and is being called into question, with forces actively at work disintegrating it, yet with the unhappy folk bred and reared under it unprepared for a new order of things. The old faith was breaking down, its forms and beliefs, once so full of life and meaning, were being sharply examined, doubt and suspicion were the order of the day. Moreover, it must ever be borne in mind that in the Philippines this unrest, except in the parts where the friars were the landlords, was not general among the people, the masses of whom were still sunk in their “loved Egyptian night,” but affected only a very small proportion of the population—for the most part young men who were groping their way toward something better, yet without any very clearly conceived idea of what that better might be, and among whom was to be found the usual sprinkling of “sunshine patriots” and omnipresent opportunists ready for any kind of trouble that will afford them a chance to rise.\nAdd to the apathy of the masses dragging out their vacant lives amid the shadows of religious superstition and to the unrest of the few, the fact that the orders were in absolute control of the political machinery of the country, with the best part of the agrarian wealth amortized in their hands; add also the ever-present jealousies, petty feuds, and racial hatreds, for which Manila and the Philippines, with their medley of creeds and races, offer such a fertile field, all fostered by the governing class for the maintenance of the old Machiavelian principle of “divide and rule,” and the sum is about the most miserable condition under which any portion of mankind ever tried to fulfill nature’s inexorable laws of growth.\n Translator’s Introduction II  And third came she who gives dark creeds their power,\nSilabbat-paramasa, sorceress,\nDraped fair in many lands as lowly Faith,\nBut ever juggling souls with rites and prayers;\nThe keeper of those keys which lock up Hells\nAnd open Heavens. “Wilt thou dare,” she said,\n“Put by our sacred books, dethrone our gods,\nUnpeople all the temples, shaking down\nThat law which feeds the priests and props the realm?”\nBut Buddha answered, “What thou bidd’st me keep\nIs form which passes, but the free Truth stands;\nGet thee unto thy darkness.”\nSIR EDWIN ARNOLD, The Light of Asia\n “Ah, simple people, how little do you know the blessing that you enjoy! Neither hunger, nor nakedness, nor inclemency of the weather troubles you. With the payment of seven reals per year, you remain free of contributions. You do not have to close your houses with bolts. You do not fear that the district troopers will come in to lay waste your fields, and trample you under foot at your own firesides. You call ‘father’ the one who is in command over you. Perhaps there will come a time when you will be more civilized, and you will break out in revolution; and you will wake terrified, at the tumult of the riots, and will see blood flowing through these quiet fields, and gallows and guillotines erected in these squares, which never yet have seen an execution.”[6] Thus moralized a Spanish traveler in 1842, just as that dolce far niente was drawing to its close. Already far-seeing men had begun to raise in the Spanish parliament the question of the future of the Philippines, looking toward some definite program for their care under modern conditions and for the adjustment of their relations with the mother country. But these were mere Cassandra-voices—the horologe of time was striking for Rome’s successor, as it did for Rome herself.\nJust where will come the outbreak after three centuries of mind-repression and soul-distortion, of forcing a growing subject into the strait-jacket of medieval thought and action, of natural selection reversed by the constant elimination of native initiative and leadership, is indeed a curious study. That there will be an outbreak somewhere is as certain as that the plant will grow toward the light, even under the most unfavorable conditions, for man’s nature is but the resultant of eternal forces that ceaselessly and irresistibly interplay about and upon him, and somewhere this resultant will express itself in thought or deed.\nAfter three centuries of Spanish ecclesiastical domination in the Philippines, it was to be expected that the wards would turn against their mentors the methods that had been used upon them, nor is it especially remarkable that there was a decided tendency in some parts to revert to primitive barbarism, but that concurrently a creative genius—a bard or seer—should have been developed among a people who, as a whole, have hardly passed through the clan or village stage of society, can be regarded as little less than a psychological phenomenon, and provokes the perhaps presumptuous inquiry as to whether there may not be some things about our common human nature that the learned doctors have not yet included in their anthropometric diagrams.\nOn the western shore of the Lake of Bay in the heart of the Philippines clusters the village of Kalamba, first established by the Jesuit Fathers in the early days of the conquest, and upon their expulsion in 1767 taken over by the Crown, which later transferred it to the Dominicans, under whose care the fertile fields about it became one of the richest of the friar estates. It can hardly be called a town, even for the Philippines, but is rather a market-village, set as it is at the outlet of the rich country of northern Batangas on the open waterway to Manila and the outside world. Around it flourish the green rice-fields, while Mount Makiling towers majestically near in her moods of cloud and sunshine, overlooking the picturesque curve of the shore and the rippling waters of the lake. Shadowy to the eastward gleam the purple crests of Banahao and Cristobal, and but a few miles to the southwestward dim-thundering, seething, earth-rocking Taal mutters and moans of the world’s birth-throes. It is the center of a region rich in native lore and legend, as it sleeps through the dusty noons when the cacao leaves droop with the heat and dreams through the silvery nights, waking twice or thrice a week to the endless babble and ceaseless chatter of an Oriental market where the noisy throngs make of their trading as much a matter of pleasure and recreation as of business.\nDirectly opposite this market-place, in a house facing the village church, there was born in 1861 into the already large family of one of the more prosperous tenants on the Dominican estate a boy who was to combine in his person the finest traits of the Oriental character with the best that Spanish and European culture could add, on whom would fall the burden of his people’s woes to lead him over the via dolorosa of struggle and sacrifice, ending in his own destruction amid the crumbling ruins of the system whose disintegration he himself had done so much to compass.\nJosé Rizal-Mercado y Alonso, as his name emerges from the confusion of Filipino nomenclature, was of Malay extraction, with some distant strains of Spanish and Chinese blood. His genealogy reveals several persons remarkable for intellect and independence of character, notably a Philippine Eloise and Abelard, who, drawn together by their common enthusiasm for study and learning, became his maternal grandparents, as well as a great-uncle who was a traveler and student and who directed the boy’s early studies. Thus from the beginning his training was exceptional, while his mind was stirred by the trouble already brewing in his community, and from the earliest hours of consciousness he saw about him the wrongs and injustices which overgrown power will ever develop in dealing with a weaker subject. One fact of his childhood, too, stands out clearly, well worthy of record: his mother seems to have been a woman of more than ordinary education for the time and place, and, pleased with the boy’s quick intelligence, she taught him to read Spanish from a copy of the Vulgate in that language, which she had somehow managed to secure and keep in her possession—the old, old story of the Woman and the Book, repeated often enough under strange circumstances, but under none stranger than these. The boy’s father was well-to-do, so he was sent at the age of eight to study in the new Jesuit school in Manila, not however before he had already inspired some awe in his simple neighbors by the facility with which he composed verses in his native tongue.\nHe began his studies in a private house while waiting for an opportunity to enter the Ateneo, as the Jesuit school is called, and while there he saw one of his tutors, Padre Burgos, haled to an ignominious death on the garrote as a result of the affair of 1872. This made a deep impression on his childish mind and, in fact, seems to have been one of the principal factors in molding his ideas and shaping his career. That the effect upon him was lasting and that his later judgment confirmed him in the belief that a great injustice had been done, are shown by the fact that his second important work, El Filibusterismo, written about 1891, and miscalled by himself a “novel,” for it is really a series of word-paintings constituting a terrific arraignment of the whole régime, was dedicated to the three priests executed in 1872, in these words: “Religion, in refusing to degrade you, has placed in doubt the crime imputed to you; the government, in surrounding your case with mystery and shadow, gives reason for belief in some error, committed in fatal moments; and all the Philippines, in venerating your memory and calling you martyrs, in no way acknowledges your guilt.” The only answer he ever received to this was eight Remington bullets fired into his back.\nIn the Ateneo he quickly attracted attention and became a general favorite by his application to his studies, the poetic fervor with which he entered into all the exercises of religious devotion, and the gentleness of his character. He was from the first considered “peculiar,” for so the common mind regards everything that fails to fit the old formulas, being of a rather dreamy and reticent disposition, more inclined to reading Spanish romances than joining in the games of his schoolmates. And of all the literatures that could be placed in the hands of an imaginative child, what one would be more productive in a receptive mind of a fervid love of life and home and country and all that men hold dear, than that of the musical language of Castile, with its high coloring and passionate character?\nHis activities were varied, for, in addition to his regular studies, he demonstrated considerable skill in wood-carving and wax-modeling, and during this period won several prizes for poetical compositions in Spanish, which, while sometimes juvenile in form and following closely after Spanish models, reveal at times flashes of thought and turns of expression that show distinct originality; even in these early compositions there is that plaintive undertone, that minor chord of sadness, which pervades all his poems, reaching its fullest measure of pathos in the verses written in his death-cell. He received a bachelor’s degree according to the Spanish system in 1877, but continued advanced studies in agriculture at the Ateneo, at the same time that he was pursuing the course in philosophy in the Dominican University of Santo Tomas, where in 1879 he startled the learned doctors by a reference in a prize poem to the Philippines as his “patria,” fatherland. This political heresy on the part of a native of the islands was given no very serious attention at the time, being looked upon as the vagary of a schoolboy, but again in the following year, by what seems a strange fatality, he stirred the resentment of the friars, especially the Dominicans, by winning over some of their number the first prize in a literary contest celebrated in honor of the author of Don Quixote.\nThe archaic instruction in Santo Tomas soon disgusted him and led to disagreements with the instructors, and he turned to Spain. Plans for his journey and his stay there had to be made with the utmost caution, for it would hardly have fared well with his family had it become known that the son of a tenant on an estate which was a part of the University endowment was studying in Europe. He reached Spanish territory first in Barcelona, the hotbed of radicalism, where he heard a good deal of revolutionary talk, which, however, seems to have made but little impression upon him, for throughout his entire career breadth of thought and strength of character are revealed in his consistent opposition to all forms of violence.\nIn Madrid he pursued the courses in medicine and philosophy, but a fact of even more consequence than his proficiency in his regular work was his persistent study of languages and his omnivorous reading. He was associated with the other Filipinos who were working in a somewhat spectacular way, misdirected rather than led by what may be styled the Spanish liberals, for more considerate treatment of the Philippines. But while he was among them he was not of them, as his studious habits and reticent disposition would hardly have made him a favorite among those who were enjoying the broader and gayer life there. Moreover, he soon advanced far beyond them in thought by realizing that they were beginning at the wrong end of the labor, for even at that time he seems to have caught, by what must almost be looked upon as an inspiration of genius, since there was nothing apparent in his training that would have suggested it, the realization of the fact that hope for his people lay in bettering their condition, that any real benefit must begin with the benighted folk at home, that the introduction of reforms for which they were unprepared would be useless, even dangerous to them. This was not at all the popular idea among his associates and led to serious disagreements with their leaders, for it was the way of toil and sacrifice without any of the excitement and glamour that came from drawing up magnificent plans and sending them back home with appeals for funds to carry on the propaganda—for the most part banquets and entertainments to Spain’s political leaders.\nHis views, as revealed in his purely political writings, may be succinctly stated, for he had that faculty of expression which never leaves any room for doubt as to the meaning. His people had a natural right to grow and to develop, and any obstacles to such growth and development were to be removed. He realized that the masses of his countrymen were sunk deep in poverty and ignorance, cringing and crouching before political authority, crawling and groveling before religious superstition, but to him this was no subject for jest or indifferent neglect—it was a serious condition which should be ameliorated, and hope lay in working into the inert social mass the leaven of conscious individual effort toward the development of a distinctive, responsible personality. He was profoundly appreciative of all the good that Spain had done, but saw in this no inconsistency with the desire that this gratitude might be given cause to be ever on the increase, thereby uniting the Philippines with the mother country by the firm bonds of common ideas and interests, for his earlier writings breathe nothing but admiration, respect, and loyalty for Spain and her more advanced institutions. The issue was clear to him and he tried to keep it so.\nIt was indeed administrative myopia, induced largely by blind greed, which allowed the friar orders to confuse the objections to their repressive system with an attack upon Spanish sovereignty, thereby dragging matters from bad to worse, to engender ill feeling and finally desperation. This narrow, selfish policy had about as much soundness in it as the idea upon which it was based, so often brought forward with what looks very suspiciously like a specious effort to cover mental indolence with a glittering generality, “that the Filipino is only a grown-up child and needs a strong paternal government,” an idea which entirely overlooks the natural fact that when an impressionable subject comes within the influence of a stronger force from a higher civilization he is very likely to remain a child—perhaps a stunted one—as long as he is treated as such. There is about as much sense and justice in such logic as there would be in that of keeping a babe confined in swaddling-bands and then blaming it for not knowing how to walk. No creature will remain a healthy child forever, but, as Spain learned to her bitter cost, will be very prone, as the parent grows decrepit and it begins to feel its strength, to prove a troublesome subject to handle, thereby reversing the natural law suggested by the comparison, and bringing such Sancho-Panza statecraft to flounder at last through as hopeless confusion to as absurd a conclusion as his own island government.\nRizal was not one of those rabid, self-seeking revolutionists who would merely overthrow the government and maintain the old system with themselves in the privileged places of the former rulers, nor is he to be classed among the misguided enthusiasts who by their intemperate demands and immoderate conduct merely strengthen the hands of those in power. He realized fully that the restrictions under which the people had become accustomed to order their lives should be removed gradually as they advanced under suitable guidance and became capable of adjusting themselves to the new and better conditions. They should take all the good offered, from any source, especially that suited to their nature, which they could properly assimilate. No great patience was ever exhibited by him toward those of his countrymen–the most repulsive characters in his stories are such–who would make of themselves mere apes and mimes, decorating themselves with a veneer of questionable alien characteristics, but with no personality or stability of their own, presenting at best a spectacle to make devils laugh and angels weep, lacking even the hothouse product’s virtue of being good to look upon.\nReduced to a definite form, the wish of the more thoughtful in the new generation of Filipino leaders that was growing up was that the Philippine Islands be made a province of Spain with representation in the Cortes and the concomitant freedom of expression and criticism. All that was directly asked was some substantial participation in the management of local affairs, and the curtailment of the arbitrary power of petty officials, especially of the friar curates, who constituted the chief obstacle to the education and development of the people.\nThe friar orders were, however, all-powerful, not only in the Philippines, but also in Madrid, where they were not chary of making use of a part of their wealth to maintain their influence. The efforts of the Filipinos in Spain, while closely watched, do not seem to have been given any very serious attention, for the Spanish authorities no doubt realized that as long as the young men stayed in Madrid writing manifestoes in a language which less than one per cent of their countrymen could read and spending their money on members of the Cortes, there could be little danger of trouble in the Philippines. Moreover, the Spanish ministers themselves appear to have been in sympathy with the more moderate wishes of the Filipinos, a fact indicated by the number of changes ordered from time to time in the Philippine administration, but they were powerless before the strength and local influence of the religious orders. So matters dragged their weary way along until there was an unexpected and startling development, a David-Goliath contest, and certainly no one but a genius could have polished the “smooth stone” that was to smite the giant.\nIt is said that the idea of writing a novel depicting conditions in his native land first came to Rizal from a perusal of Eugene Sue’s The Wandering Jew, while he was a student in Madrid, although the model for the greater part of it is plainly the delectable sketches in Don Quixote, for the author himself possessed in a remarkable degree that Cervantic touch which raises the commonplace, even the mean, into the highest regions of art. Not, however, until he had spent some time in Paris continuing his medical studies, and later in Germany, did anything definite result. But in 1887 Noli Me Tangere was printed in Berlin, in an establishment where the author is said to have worked part of his time as a compositor in order to defray his expenses while he continued his studies. A limited edition was published through the financial aid extended by a Filipino associate, and sent to Hongkong, thence to be surreptitiously introduced into the Philippines.\nNoli Me Tangere (“Touch Me Not”) at the time the work was written had a peculiar fitness as a title. Not only was there an apt suggestion of a comparison with the common flower of that name, but the term is also applied in pathology to a malignant cancer which affects every bone and tissue in the body, and that this latter was in the author’s mind would appear from the dedication and from the summing-up of the Philippine situation in the final conversation between Ibarra and Elias. But in a letter written to a friend in Paris at the time, the author himself says that it was taken from the Gospel scene where the risen Savior appears to the Magdalene, to whom He addresses these words, a scene that has been the subject of several notable paintings.\nIn this connection it is interesting to note what he himself thought of the work, and his frank statement of what he had tried to accomplish, made just as he was publishing it: “Noli Me Tangere, an expression taken from the Gospel of St. Luke,[7] means touch me not. The book contains things of which no one up to the present time has spoken, for they are so sensitive that they have never suffered themselves to be touched by any one whomsoever. For my own part, I have attempted to do what no one else has been willing to do: I have dared to answer the calumnies that have for centuries been heaped upon us and our country. I have written of the social condition and the life, of our beliefs, our hopes, our longings, our complaints, and our sorrows; I have unmasked the hypocrisy which, under the cloak of religion, has come among us to impoverish and to brutalize us, I have distinguished the true religion from the false, from the superstition that traffics with the holy word to get money and to make us believe in absurdities for which Catholicism would blush, if ever it knew of them. I have unveiled that which has been hidden behind the deceptive and dazzling words of our governments. I have told our countrymen of our mistakes, our vices, our faults, and our weak complaisance with our miseries there. Where I have found virtue I have spoken of it highly in order to render it homage; and if I have not wept in speaking of our misfortunes, I have laughed over them, for no one would wish to weep with me over our woes, and laughter is ever the best means of concealing sorrow. The deeds that I have related are true and have actually occurred; I can furnish proof of this. My book may have (and it does have) defects from an artistic and esthetic point of view—this I do not deny—but no one can dispute the veracity of the facts presented.”[8]\nBut while the primary purpose and first effect of the work was to crystallize anti-friar sentiment, the author has risen above a mere personal attack, which would give it only a temporary value, and by portraying in so clear and sympathetic a way the life of his people has produced a piece of real literature, of especial interest now as they are being swept into the newer day. Any fool can point out errors and defects, if they are at all apparent, and the persistent searching them out for their own sake is the surest mark of the vulpine mind, but the author has east aside all such petty considerations and, whether consciously or not, has left a work of permanent value to his own people and of interest to all friends of humanity. If ever a fair land has been cursed with the wearisome breed of fault-finders, both indigenous and exotic, that land is the Philippines, so it is indeed refreshing to turn from the dreary waste of carping criticisms, pragmatical “scientific” analyses, and sneering half-truths to a story pulsating with life, presenting the Filipino as a human being, with his virtues and his vices, his loves and hates, his hopes and fears.\nThe publication of Noli Me Tangere suggests the reflection that the story of Achilles’ heel is a myth only in form. The belief that any institution, system, organization, or arrangement has reached an absolute form is about as far as human folly can go. The friar orders looked upon themselves as the sum of human achievement in man-driving and God-persuading, divinely appointed to rule, fixed in their power, far above suspicion. Yet they were obsessed by the sensitive, covert dread of exposure that ever lurks spectrally under pharisaism’s specious robe, so when there appeared this work of a “miserable Indian,” who dared to portray them and the conditions that their control produced exactly as they were—for the indefinable touch by which the author gives an air of unimpeachable veracity to his story is perhaps its greatest artistic merit—the effect upon the mercurial Spanish temperament was, to say the least, electric. The very audacity of the thing left the friars breathless.\nA committee of learned doctors from Santo Tomas, who were appointed to examine the work, unmercifully scored it as attacking everything from the state religion to the integrity of the Spanish dominions, so the circulation of it in the Philippines was, of course, strictly prohibited, which naturally made the demand for it greater. Large sums were paid for single copies, of which, it might be remarked in passing, the author himself received scarcely any part; collections have ever had a curious habit of going astray in the Philippines.\nAlthough the possession of a copy by a Filipino usually meant summary imprisonment or deportation, often with the concomitant confiscation of property for the benefit of some “patriot,” the book was widely read among the leading families and had the desired effect of crystallizing the sentiment against the friars, thus to pave the way for concerted action. At last the idol had been flouted, so all could attack it. Within a year after it had begun to circulate in the Philippines a memorial was presented to the Archbishop by quite a respectable part of the Filipinos in Manila, requesting that the friar orders be expelled from the country, but this resulted only in the deportation of every signer of the petition upon whom the government could lay hands. They were scattered literally to the four corners of the earth: some to the Ladrone Islands, some to Fernando Po off the west coast of Africa, some to Spanish prisons, others to remote parts of the Philippines.\nMeanwhile, the author had returned to the Philippines for a visit to his family, during which time he was constantly attended by an officer of the Civil Guard, detailed ostensibly as a body-guard. All his movements were closely watched, and after a few months the Captain-General “advised” him to leave the country, at the same time requesting a copy of Noli Me Tangere, saying that the excerpts submitted to him by the censor had awakened a desire to read the entire work. Rizal returned to Europe by way of Japan and the United States, which did not seem to make any distinct impression upon him, although it was only a little later that he predicted that when Spain lost control of the Philippines, an eventuality he seemed to consider certain not far in the future, the United States would be a probable successor.[9]\nReturning to Europe, he spent some time in London preparing an edition of Morga’s Sucesos de las Filipinas, a work published in Mexico about 1606 by the principal actor in some of the most stirring scenes of the formative period of the Philippine government. It is a record of prime importance in Philippine history, and the resuscitation of it was no small service to the country. Rizal added notes tending to show that the Filipinos had been possessed of considerable culture and civilization before the Spanish conquest, and he even intimated that they had retrograded rather than advanced under Spanish tutelage. But such an extreme view must be ascribed to patriotic ardor, for Rizal himself, though possessed of that intangible quality commonly known as genius and partly trained in northern Europe, is still in his own personality the strongest refutation of such a contention.\nLater, in Ghent, he published El Filibusterismo, called by him a continuation of Noli Me Tangere, but with which it really has no more connection than that some of the characters reappear and are disposed of.[10] There is almost no connected plot in it and hardly any action, but there is the same incisive character-drawing and clear etching of conditions that characterize the earlier work. It is a maturer effort and a more forceful political argument, hence it lacks the charm and simplicity which assign Noli Me Tangere to a preeminent place in Philippine literature. The light satire of the earlier work is replaced by bitter sarcasm delivered with deliberate intent, for the iron had evidently entered his soul with broadening experience and the realization that justice at the hands of decadent Spain had been an iridescent dream of his youth. Nor had the Spanish authorities in the Philippines been idle; his relatives had been subjected to all the annoyances and irritations of petty persecution, eventually losing the greater part of their property, while some of them suffered deportation.\nIn 1891 he returned to Hongkong to practise medicine, in which profession he had remarkable success, even coming to be looked upon as a wizard by his simple countrymen, among whom circulated wonderful accounts of his magical powers. He was especially skilled in ophthalmology, and his first operation after returning from his studies in Europe was to restore his mother’s sight by removing a cataract from one of her eyes, an achievement which no doubt formed the basis of marvelous tales. But the misfortunes of his people were ever the paramount consideration, so he wrote to the Captain-General requesting permission to remove his numerous relatives to Borneo to establish a colony there, for which purpose liberal concessions had been offered him by the British government. The request was denied, and further stigmatized as an “unpatriotic” attempt to lessen the population of the Philippines, when labor was already scarce. This was the answer he received to a reasonable petition after the homes of his family, including his own birthplace, had been ruthlessly destroyed by military force, while a quarrel over ownership and rents was still pending in the courts. The Captain-General at the time was Valeriano Weyler, the pitiless instrument of the reactionary forces manipulated by the monastic orders, he who was later sent to Cuba to introduce there the repressive measures which had apparently been so efficacious in the Philippines, thus to bring on the interference of the United States to end Spain’s colonial power—all of which induces the reflection that there may still be deluded casuists who doubt the reality of Nemesis.\nWeyler was succeeded by Eulogio Despujols, who made sincere attempts to reform the administration, and was quite popular with the Filipinos. In reply to repeated requests from Rizal to be permitted to return to the Philippines unmolested a passport was finally granted to him and he set out for Manila. For this move on his part, in addition to the natural desire to be among his own people, two special reasons appear: he wished to investigate and stop if possible the unwarranted use of his name in taking up collections that always remained mysteriously unaccounted for, and he was drawn by a ruse deliberately planned and executed in that his mother was several times officiously arrested and hustled about as a common criminal in order to work upon the son’s filial feelings and thus get him back within reach of the Spanish authority, which, as subsequent events and later researches have shown, was the real intention in issuing the passport. Entirely unsuspecting any ulterior motive, however, in a few days after his arrival he convoked a motley gathering of Filipinos of all grades of the population, for he seems to have been only slightly acquainted among his own people and not at all versed in the mazy Walpurgis dance of Philippine politics, and laid before it the constitution for a Liga Filipina (Philippine League), an organization looking toward greater unity among the Filipinos and coöperation for economic progress. This Liga was no doubt the result of his observations in England and Germany, and, despite its questionable form as a secret society for political and economic purposes, was assuredly a step in the right direction, but unfortunately its significance was beyond the comprehension of his countrymen, most of whom saw in it only an opportunity for harassing the Spanish government, for which all were ready enough.\nAll his movements were closely watched, and a few days after his return he was arrested on the charge of having seditious literature in his baggage. The friars were already clamoring for his blood, but Despujols seems to have been more in sympathy with Rizal than with the men whose tool he found himself forced to be. Without trial Rizal was ordered deported to Dapitan, a small settlement on the northern coast of Mindanao. The decree ordering this deportation and the destruction of all copies of his books to be found in the Philippines is a marvel of sophistry, since, in the words of a Spanish writer of the time, “in this document we do not know which to wonder at most: the ingenuousness of the Governor-General, for in this decree he implicitly acknowledges his weakness and proneness to error, or the candor of Rizal, who believed that all the way was strewn with roses.”[11] But it is quite evident that Despujols was playing a double game, of which he seems to have been rather ashamed, for he gave strict orders that copies of the decree should be withheld from Rizal.\nIn Dapitan Rizal gave himself up to his studies and such medical practice as sought him out in that remote spot, for the fame of his skill was widely extended, and he was allowed to live unmolested under parole that he would make no attempt to escape. In company with a Jesuit missionary he gathered about him a number of native boys and conducted a practical school on the German plan, at the same time indulging in religious polemics with his Jesuit acquaintances by correspondence and working fitfully on some compositions which were never completed, noteworthy among them being a study in English of the Tagalog verb.\nBut while he was living thus quietly in Dapitan, events that were to determine his fate were misshaping themselves in Manila. The stone had been loosened on the mountain-side and was bounding on in mad career, far beyond his control.\n Translator’s Introduction III  He who of old would rend the oak,\nDream’d not of the rebound;\nChain’d by the trunk he vainly broke\nAlone—how look’d he round?\nBYRON\n Reason and moderation in the person of Rizal scorned and banished, the spirit of Jean Paul Marat and John Brown of Ossawatomie rises to the fore in the shape of one Andres Bonifacio, warehouse porter, who sits up o’ nights copying all the letters and documents that he can lay hands on; composing grandiloquent manifestoes in Tagalog; drawing up magnificent appointments in the names of prominent persons who would later suffer even to the shedding of their life’s blood through his mania for writing history in advance; spelling out Spanish tales of the French Revolution; babbling of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity; hinting darkly to his confidants that the President of France had begun life as a blacksmith. Only a few days after Rizal was so summarily hustled away, Bonifacio gathered together a crowd of malcontents and ignorant dupes, some of them composing as choice a gang of cutthroats as ever slit the gullet of a Chinese or tied mutilated prisoners in ant hills, and solemnly organized the Kataastaasang Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng̃ mga Anak ng̃ Bayan, “Supreme Select Association of the Sons of the People,” for the extermination of the ruling race and the restoration of the Golden Age. It was to bring the people into concerted action for a general revolt on a fixed date, when they would rise simultaneously, take possession of the city of Manila, and—the rest were better left to the imagination, for they had been reared under the Spanish colonial system and imitativeness has ever been pointed out as a cardinal trait in the Filipino character. No quarter was to be asked or given, and the most sacred ties, even of consanguinity, were to be disregarded in the general slaughter. To the inquiry of a curious neophyte as to how the Spaniards were to be distinguished from the other Europeans, in order to avoid international complications, dark Andres replied that in case of doubt they should proceed with due caution but should take good care that they made no mistakes about letting any of the Castilas escape their vengeance. The higher officials of the government were to be taken alive as hostages, while the friars were to be reserved for a special holocaust on Bagumbayan Field, where over their incinerated remains a heaven-kissing monument would be erected.\nThis Katipunan seems to have been an outgrowth from Spanish freemasonry, introduced into the Philippines by a Spaniard named Morayta and Marcelo H. del Pilar, a native of Bulacan Province who was the practical leader of the Filipinos in Spain, but who died there in 1896 just as he was setting out for Hongkong to mature his plans for a general uprising to expel the friar orders. There had been some masonic societies in the islands for some time, but the membership had been limited to Peninsulars, and they played no part in the politics of the time. But about 1888 Filipinos began to be admitted into some of them, and later, chiefly through the exertions of Pilar, lodges exclusively for them were instituted. These soon began to display great activity, especially in the transcendental matter of collections, so that their existence became a source of care to the government and a nightmare to the religious orders. From them, and with a perversion of the idea in Rizal’s still-born Liga, it was an easy transition to the Katipunan, which was to put aside all pretense of reconciliation with Spain, and at the appointed time rise to exterminate not only the friars but also all the Spaniards and Spanish sympathizers, thus to bring about the reign of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, under the benign guidance of Patriot Bonifacio, with his bolo for a scepter.\nWith its secrecy and mystic forms, its methods of threats and intimidation, the Katipunan spread rapidly, especially among the Tagalogs, the most intransigent of the native peoples, and, it should be noted, the ones in Whose territory the friars were the principal landlords. It was organized on the triangle plan, so that no member might know or communicate with more than three others—the one above him from whom he received his information and instructions and two below to whom he transmitted them. The initiations were conducted with great secrecy and solemnity, calculated to inspire the new members with awe and fear. The initiate, after a series of blood-curdling ordeals to try out his courage and resolution, swore on a human skull a terrific oath to devote his life and energies to the extermination of the white race, regardless of age or sex, and later affixed to it his signature or mark, usually the latter, with his own blood taken from an incision in the left arm or left breast. This was one form of the famous “blood compact,” which, if history reads aright, played so important a part in the assumption of sovereignty over the Philippines by Legazpi in the name of Philip II.\nRizal was made the honorary president of the association, his portrait hung in all the meeting-halls, and the magic of his name used to attract the easily deluded masses, who were in a state of agitated ignorance and growing unrest, ripe for any movement that looked anti-governmental, and especially anti-Spanish. Soon after the organization had been perfected, collections began to be taken up—those collections were never overlooked—for the purpose of chartering a steamer to rescue him from Dapitan and transport him to Singapore, whence he might direct the general uprising, the day and the hour for which were fixed by Bonifacio for August twenty-sixth, 1896, at six o’clock sharp in the evening, since lack of precision in his magnificent programs was never a fault of that bold patriot, his logic being as severe as that of the Filipino policeman who put the flag at half-mast on Good Friday.\nOf all this Rizal himself was, of course, entirely ignorant, until in May, 1896, a Filipino doctor named Pio Valenzuela, a creature of Bonifacio’s, was despatched to Dapitan, taking along a blind man as a pretext for the visit to the famous oculist, to lay the plans before him for his consent and approval. Rizal expostulated with Valenzuela for a time over such a mad and hopeless venture, which would only bring ruin and misery upon the masses, and then is said to have very humanly lost his patience, ending the interview “in so bad a humor and with words so offensive that the deponent, who had gone with the intention of remaining there a month, took the steamer on the following day, for return to Manila.”[12] He reported secretly to Bonifacio, who bestowed several choice Tagalog epithets on Rizal, and charged his envoy to say nothing about the failure of his mission, but rather to give the impression that he had been successful. Rizal’s name continued to be used as the shibboleth of the insurrection, and the masses were made to believe that he would appear as their leader at the appointed hour.\nVague reports from police officers, to the effect that something unusual in the nature of secret societies was going on among the people, began to reach the government, but no great attention was paid to them, until the evening of August nineteenth, when the parish priest of Tondo was informed by the mother-superior of one of the convent-schools that she had just learned of a plot to massacre all the Spaniards. She had the information from a devoted pupil, whose brother was a compositor in the office of the Diario de Manila. As is so frequently the case in Filipino families, this elder sister was the purse-holder, and the brother’s insistent requests for money, which was needed by him to meet the repeated assessments made on the members as the critical hour approached, awakened her curiosity and suspicion to such an extent that she forced him to confide the whole plan to her. Without delay she divulged it to her patroness, who in turn notified the curate of Tondo, where the printing-office was located. The priest called in two officers of the Civil Guard, who arrested the young printer, frightened a confession out of him, and that night, in company with the friar, searched the printing-office, finding secreted there several lithographic plates for printing receipts and certificates of membership in the Katipunan, with a number of documents giving some account of the plot.\nThen the Spanish population went wild. General Ramon Blanco was governor and seems to have been about the only person who kept his head at all. He tried to prevent giving so irresponsible a movement a fictitious importance, but was utterly powerless to stay the clamor for blood which at once arose, loudest on the part of those alleged ministers of the gentle Christ. The gates of the old Walled City, long fallen into disuse, were cleaned and put in order, martial law was declared, and wholesale arrests made. Many of the prisoners were confined in Fort Santiago, one batch being crowded into a dungeon for which the only ventilation was a grated opening at the top, and one night a sergeant of the guard carelessly spread his sleeping-mat over this, so the next morning some fifty-five asphyxiated corpses were hauled away. On the twenty-sixth armed insurrection broke out at Caloocan, just north of Manila, from time immemorial the resort of bad characters from all the country round and the center of brigandage, while at San Juan del Monte, on the outskirts of the city, several bloody skirmishes were fought a few days later with the Guardia Civil Veterana, the picked police force.\nBonifacio had been warned of the discovery of his schemes in time to make his escape and flee to the barrio, or village, of Balintawak, a few miles north of Manila, thence to lead the attack on Caloocan and inaugurate the reign of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity in the manner in which Philippine insurrections have generally had a habit of starting—with the murder of Chinese merchants and the pillage of their shops. He had from the first reserved for himself the important office of treasurer in the Katipunan, in addition to being on occasions president and at all times its ruling spirit, so he now established himself as dictator and proceeded to appoint a magnificent staff, most of whom contrived to escape as soon as they were out of reach of his bolo. Yet he drew considerable numbers about him, for this man, though almost entirely unlettered, seems to have been quite a personality among his own people, especially possessed of that gift of oratory in his native tongue to which the Malay is so preeminently susceptible.\nIn Manila a special tribunal was constituted and worked steadily, sometimes through the siesta-hour, for there were times, of which this was one, when even Spanish justice could be swift. Bagumbayan began to be a veritable field of blood, as the old methods of repression were resorted to for the purpose of striking terror into the native population by wholesale executions, nor did the ruling powers realize that the time for such methods had passed. It was a case of sixteenth-century colonial methods fallen into fretful and frantic senility, so in all this wretched business it is doubtful whim to pity the more: the blind stupidity of the fossilized conservatives incontinently throwing an empire away, forfeiting their influence over a people whom they, by temperament and experience, should have been fitted to control and govern; or the potential cruelty of perverted human nature in the dark Frankenstein who would wreak upon the rulers in their decadent days the most hideous of the methods in the system that produced him, as he planned his festive holocaust and carmagnole on the spot where every spark of initiative and leadership among his people, both good and bad, had been summarily and ruthlessly extinguished. There is at least a world of reflection in it for the rulers of men.\nIn the meantime Rizal, wearying of the quiet life in Dapitan and doubtless foreseeing the impending catastrophe, had requested leave to volunteer his services as a physician in the military hospitals of Cuba, of the horrors and sufferings in which he had heard. General Blanco at once gladly acceded to this request and had him brought to Manila, but unfortunately the boat carrying him arrived there a day too late for him to catch the regular August mail-steamer to Spain, so he was kept in the cruiser a prisoner of war, awaiting the next transportation. While he was thus detained, the Katipunan plot was discovered and the rebellion broke out. He was accused of being the head of it, but Blanco gave him a personal letter completely exonerating him from any complicity in the outbreak, as well as a letter of recommendation to the Spanish minister of war. He was placed on the Isla de Panay when it left for Spain on September third and traveled at first as a passenger. At Singapore he was advised to land and claim British protection, as did some of his fellow travelers, but he refused to do so, saying that his conscience was clear.\nAs the name of Rizal had constantly recurred during the trials of the Katipunan suspects, the military tribunal finally issued a formal demand for him. The order of arrest was cabled to Port Said and Rizal there placed in solitary confinement for the remainder of the voyage. Arrived at Barcelona, he was confined in the grim fortress of Montjuich, where; by a curious coincidence, the governor was the same Despujols who had issued the decree of banishment in 1892. Shortly afterwards, he was placed on the transport Colon, which was bound for the Philippines with troops, Blanco having at last been stirred to action. Strenuous efforts were now made by Rizal’s friends in London to have him removed from the ship at Singapore, but the British authorities declined to take any action, on the ground that he was on a Spanish warship and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of their courts. The Colon arrived at Manila on November third and Rizal was imprisoned in Fort Santiago, while a special tribunal was constituted to try him on the charges of carrying on anti-patriotic and anti-religious propaganda, rebellion, sedition, and the formation of illegal associations. Some other charges may have been overlooked in the hurry and excitement.\nIt would be almost a travesty to call a trial the proceedings which began early in December and dragged along until the twenty-sixth. Rizal was defended by a young Spanish officer selected by him from among a number designated by the tribunal, who chivalrously performed so unpopular a duty as well as he could. But the whole affair was a mockery of justice, for the Spanish government in the Philippines had finally and hopelessly reached the condition graphically pictured by Mr. Kipling:\n Panic that shells the drifting spar—\nLoud waste with none to check—\nMad fear that rakes a scornful star\nOr sweeps a consort’s deck!\n The clamor against Blanco had resulted in his summary removal by royal decree and the appointment of a real “pacificator,” Camilo Polavieja.\nWhile in prison Rizal prepared an address to those of his countrymen who were in armed rebellion, repudiating the use of his name and deprecating the resort to violence. The closing words are a compendium of his life and beliefs: “Countrymen: I have given proofs, as well as the best of you, of desiring liberty for our country, and I continue to desire it. But I place as a premise the education of the people, so that by means of instruction and work they may have a personality of their own and that they may make themselves worthy of that same liberty. In my writings I have recommended the study of the civic virtues, without which there can be no redemption. I have also written (and my words have been repeated) that reforms, to be fruitful, must come from above, that those which spring from below are uncertain and insecure movements. Imbued with these ideas, I cannot do less than condemn, and I do condemn, this absurd, savage rebellion, planned behind my back, which dishonors the Filipinos and discredits those who can speak for us. I abominate all criminal actions and refuse any kind of participation in them, pitying with all my heart the dupes who have allowed themselves to be deceived. Go back, then, to your homes, and may God forgive those who have acted in bad faith.” This address, however, was not published by the Spanish authorities, since they did not consider it “patriotic” enough; instead, they killed the writer!\nRizal appeared before the tribunal bound, closely guarded by two Peninsular soldiers, but maintained his serenity throughout and answered the charges in a straightforward way. He pointed out the fact that he had never taken any great part in politics, having even quarreled with Marcelo del Pilar, the active leader of the anti-clericals, by reason of those perennial “subscriptions,” and that during the time he was accused of being the instigator and organizer of armed rebellion he had been a close prisoner in Dapitan under strict surveillance by both the military and ecclesiastical authorities. The prosecutor presented a lengthy document, which ran mostly to words, about the only definite conclusion laid down in it being that the Philippines “are, and always must remain, Spanish territory.” What there may have been in Rizal’s career to hang such a conclusion upon is not quite dear, but at any rate this learned legal light was evidently still thinking in colors on the map serenely unconscious in his European pseudo-prescience of the new and wonderful development in the Western Hemisphere–humanity militant, Lincolnism.\nThe death sentence was asked, but the longer the case dragged on the more favorable it began to look for the accused, so the president of the tribunal, after deciding, Jeffreys-like, that the charges had been proved, ordered that no further evidence be taken. Rizal betrayed some sunrise when his doom was thus foreshadowed, for, dreamer that he was, he seems not to have anticipated such a fatal eventuality for himself. He did not lose his serenity, however, even when the tribunal promptly brought in a verdict of guilty and imposed the death sentence, upon which Polavieja the next day placed his Cúmplase, fixing the morning of December thirtieth for the execution.\nSo Rizal’s fate was sealed. The witnesses against him, in so far as there was any substantial testimony at all, had been his own countrymen, coerced or cajoled into making statements which they have since repudiated as false, and which in some cases were extorted from them by threats and even torture. But he betrayed very little emotion, even maintaining what must have been an assumed cheerfulness. Only one reproach is recorded: that he had been made a dupe of, that he had been deceived by every one, even the bankeros and cocheros. His old Jesuit instructors remained with him in the capilla, or death-cell,[13] and largely through the influence of an image of the Sacred Heart, which he had carved as a schoolboy, it is claimed that a reconciliation with the Church was effected. There has been considerable pragmatical discussion as to what form of retraction from him was necessary, since he had been, after studying in Europe, a frank freethinker, but such futile polemics may safely be left to the learned doctors. That he was reconciled with the Church would seem to be evidenced by the fact that just before the execution he gave legal status as his wife to the woman, a rather remarkable Eurasian adventuress, who had lived with him in Dapitan, and the religious ceremony was the only one then recognized in the islands.[14] The greater part of his last night on earth was spent in composing a chain of verse; no very majestic flight of poesy, but a pathetic monody throbbing with patient resignation and inextinguishable hope, one of the sweetest, saddest swan-songs ever sung.\nThus he was left at the last, entirely alone. As soon as his doom became certain the Patriots had all scurried to cover, one gentle poetaster even rushing into doggerel verse to condemn him as a reversion to barbarism; the wealthier suspects betook themselves to other lands or made judicious use of their money-bags among the Spanish officials; the better classes of the population floundered hopelessly, leaderless, in the confused whirl of opinions and passions; while the voiceless millions for whom he had spoken moved on in dumb, uncomprehending silence. He had lived in that higher dreamland of the future, ahead of his countrymen, ahead even of those who assumed to be the mentors of his people, and he must learn, as does every noble soul that labors “to make the bounds of freedom wider yet,” the bitter lesson that nine-tenths, if not all, the woes that afflict humanity spring from man’s own stupid selfishness, that the wresting of the scepter from the tyrant is often the least of the task, that the bondman comes to love his bonds–like Chillon’s prisoner, his very chains and he grow friends,—but that the struggle for human freedom must go on, at whatever cost, in ever-widening circles, “wave after wave, each mightier than the last,” for as long as one body toils in fetters or one mind welters in blind ignorance, either of the slave’s base delusion or the despot’s specious illusion, there can be no final security for any free man, or his children, or his children’s children.\n Translator’s Introduction IV  God save thee, ancient Mariner!\nFrom the fiends, that plague thee thus!\nWhy look’st thou so?”—“With my cross-bow\nI shot the Albatross!\nCOLERIDGE\n It was one of those magic December mornings of the tropics—the very nuptials of earth and sky, when great Nature seems to fling herself incontinently into creation, wrapping the world in a brooding calm of light and color, that Spain chose for committing political suicide in the Philippines. Bagumbayan Field was crowded with troops, both regulars and militia, for every man capable of being trusted with arms was drawn up there, excepting only the necessary guards in other parts of the city. Extra patrols were in the streets, double guards were placed over the archiepiscopal and gubernatorial palaces. The calmest man in all Manila that day was he who must stand before the firing-squad.\nTwo special and unusual features are to be noted about this execution. All the principal actors were Filipinos: the commander of the troops and the officer directly in charge of the execution were native-born, while the firing-squad itself was drawn from a local native regiment, though it is true that on this occasion a squad of Peninsular cazadores, armed with loaded Mausers, stood directly behind them to see that they failed not in their duty. Again, there was but one victim; for it seems to have ever been the custom of the Spanish rulers to associate in these gruesome affairs some real criminals with the political offenders, no doubt with the intentional purpose of confusing the issue in the general mind. Rizal standing alone, the occasion of so much hurried preparation and fearful precaution, is a pathetic testimonial to the degree of incapacity into which the ruling powers had fallen, even in chicanery.\nAfter bidding good-by to his sister and making final disposition regarding some personal property, the doomed man, under close guard, walked calmly, even cheerfully, from Fort Santiago along the Malecon to the Luneta, accompanied by his Jesuit confessors. Arrived there, he thanked those about him for their kindness and requested the officer in charge to allow him to face the firing-squad, since he had never been a traitor to Spain. This the officer declined to permit, for the order was to shoot him in the back. Rizal assented with a slight protest, pointed out to the soldiers the spot in his back at which they should aim, and with a firm step took his place in front of them.\nThen occurred an act almost too hideous to record. There he stood, expecting a volley of Remington bullets in his back—Time was, and Life’s stream ebbed to Eternity’s flood—when the military surgeon stepped forward and asked if he might feel his pulse! Rizal extended his left hand, and the officer remarked that he could not understand how a man’s pulse could beat normally at such a terrific moment! The victim shrugged his shoulders and let the hand fall again to his side—Latin refinement could be no further refined!\nA moment later there he lay, on his right side, his life-blood spurting over the Luneta curb, eyes wide open, fixedly staring at that Heaven where the priests had taught all those centuries agone that Justice abides. The troops filed past the body, for the most part silently, while desultory cries of “Viva España!” from among the “patriotic” Filipino volunteers were summarily hushed by a Spanish artillery-officer’s stern rebuke: “Silence, you rabble!” To drown out the fitful cheers and the audible murmurs, the bands struck up Spanish national airs. Stranger death-dirge no man and system ever had. Carnival revelers now dance about the scene and Filipino schoolboys play baseball over that same spot.\nA few days later another execution was held on that spot, of members of the Liga, some of them characters that would have richly deserved shooting at any place or time, according to existing standards, but notable among them there knelt, torture-crazed, as to his orisons, Francisco Roxas, millionaire capitalist, who may be regarded as the social and economic head of the Filipino people, as Rizal was fitted to be their intellectual leader. Shades of Anda and Vargas! Out there [l]at Balintawak—rather fitly, “the home of the snake-demon,”—not three hours’ march from this same spot, on the very edge of the city, Andres Bonifacio and his literally sansculottic gangs of cutthroats were, almost with impunity, soiling the fair name of Freedom with murder and mutilation, rape and rapine, awakening the worst passions of an excitable, impulsive people, destroying that essential respect for law and order, which to restore would take a holocaust of fire and blood, with a generation of severe training. Unquestionably did Rizal demonstrate himself to be a seer and prophet when he applied to such a system the story of Babylon and the fateful handwriting on the wall!\nBut forces had been loosed that would not be so suppressed, the time had gone by when such wild methods of repression would serve. The destruction of the native leaders, culminating in the executions of Rizal and Roxas, produced a counter-effect by rousing the Tagalogs, good and bad alike, to desperate fury, and the aftermath was frightful. The better classes were driven to take part in the rebellion, and Cavite especially became a veritable slaughter-pen, as the contest settled down into a hideous struggle for mutual extermination. Dark Andres went his wild way to perish by the violence he had himself invoked, a prey to the rising ambition of a young leader of considerable culture and ability, a schoolmaster named Emilio Aguinaldo. His Katipunan hovered fitfully around Manila, for a time even drawing to itself in their desperation some of the better elements of the population, only to find itself sold out and deserted by its leaders, dying away for a time; but later, under changed conditions, it reappeared in strange metamorphosis as the rallying-center for the largest number of Filipinos who have ever gathered together for a common purpose, and then finally went down before those thin grim lines in khaki with sharp and sharpest shot clearing away the wreck of the old, blazing the way for the new: the broadening sweep of “Democracy announcing, in rifle-volleys death-winged, under her Star Banner, to the tune of Yankee-doodle-do, that she is born, and, whirlwind-like, will envelop the whole world!”\nMANILA, December 1, 1909\n [1] Quoted by Macaulay: Essay on the Succession in Spain.\n[2] The ruins of the Fuerza de Playa Honda, ó Real de Paynavén, are still to be seen in the present municipality of Botolan, Zambales.

The rest of this comment of Retana’s deserves quotation as an estimate of the living man by a Spanish publicist who was at the time in the employ of the friars and contemptuously hostile to Rizal, but who has since 1898 been giving quite a spectacular demonstration of waving a red light after the wreck, having become his most enthusiastic, almost hysterical, biographer: “Rizal is what is commonly called a character, but he has repeatedly demonstrated very great inexperience in the affairs of life. I believe him to be now about thirty-two years old. He is the Indian of most ability among those who have written.”\n[12] From Valenzuela’s deposition before the military tribunal, September sixth, 1896.\n[13] Capilla: the Spanish practise is to place a condemned person for the twenty-four hours preceding his execution in a chapel, or a cell fitted up as such, where he may devote himself to religious exercises and receive the final ministrations of the Church.\n[14] But even this conclusion is open to doubt: there is no proof beyond the unsupported statement of the Jesuits that he made a written retraction, which was later destroyed, though why a document so interesting, and so important in support of their own point of view, should not have been preserved furnishes an illuminating commentary on the whole confused affair. The only unofficial witness present was the condemned man’s sister, and her declaration, that she was at the time in such a state of excitement and distress that she is unable to affirm positively that there was a real marriage ceremony performed, can readily be accepted. It must be remembered that the Jesuits were themselves under the official and popular ban for the part they had played in Rizal’s education and development and that they were seeking to set themselves right in order to maintain their prestige. Add to this the persistent and systematic effort made to destroy every scrap of record relating to the man—the sole gleam of shame evidenced in the impolitic, idiotic, and pusillanimous treatment of him—and the whole question becomes such a puzzle that it may just as well be left in darkness, with a throb of pity for the unfortunate victim caught in such a maelstrom of panic-stricken passion and selfish intrigue.\n What?

In spite of the fact that, contrary to his usual custom, he had made the announcement only that afternoon, it was already the sole topic of conversation in Binondo and adjacent districts, and even in the Walled City, for at that time Capitan Tiago was considered one of the most hospitable of men, and it was well known that his house, like his country, shut its doors against nothing except commerce and all new or bold ideas. Like an electric shock the announcement ran through the world of parasites, bores, and hangers-on, whom God in His infinite bounty creates and so kindly multiplies in Manila. Some looked at once for shoe-polish, others for buttons and cravats, but all were especially concerned about how to greet the master of the house in the most familiar tone, in order to create an atmosphere of ancient friendship or, if occasion should arise, to excuse a late arrival.\nThis dinner was given in a house on Calle Anloague, and although we do not remember the number we will describe it in such a way that it may still be recognized, provided the earthquakes have not destroyed it. We do not believe that its owner has had it torn down, for such labors are generally entrusted to God or nature—which Powers hold the contracts also for many of the projects of our government. It is a rather large building, in the style of many in the country, and fronts upon the arm of the Pasig which is known to some as the Binondo River, and which, like all the streams in Manila, plays the varied rôles of bath, sewer, laundry, fishery, means of transportation and communication, and even drinking water if the Chinese water-carrier finds it convenient. It is worthy of note that in the distance of nearly a mile this important artery of the district, where traffic is most dense and movement most deafening, can boast of only one wooden bridge, which is out of repair on one side for six months and impassable on the other for the rest of the year, so that during the hot season the ponies take advantage of this permanent status quo to jump off the bridge into the water, to the great surprise of the abstracted mortal who may be dozing inside the carriage or philosophizing upon the progress of the age.\nThe house of which we are speaking is somewhat low and not exactly correct in all its lines: whether the architect who built it was afflicted with poor eyesight or whether the earthquakes and typhoons have twisted it out of shape, no one can say with certainty. A wide staircase with green newels and carpeted steps leads from the tiled entrance up to the main floor between rows of flower-pots set upon pedestals of motley-colored and fantastically decorated Chinese porcelain. Since there are neither porters nor servants who demand invitation cards, we will go in, O you who read this, whether friend or foe, if you are attracted by the strains of the orchestra, the lights, or the suggestive rattling of dishes, knives, and forks, and if you wish to see what such a gathering is like in the distant Pearl of the Orient. Gladly, and for my own comfort, I should spare you this description of the house, were it not of great importance, since we mortals in general are very much like tortoises: we are esteemed and classified according to our shells; in this and still other respects the mortals of the Philippines in particular also resemble tortoises.\nIf we go up the stairs, we immediately find ourselves in a spacious hallway, called there, for some unknown reason, the caida, which tonight serves as the dining-room and at the same time affords a place for the orchestra. In the center a large table profusely and expensively decorated seems to beckon to the hanger-on with sweet promises, while it threatens the bashful maiden, the simple dalaga, with two mortal hours in the company of strangers whose language and conversation usually have a very restricted and special character.\nContrasted with these terrestrial preparations are the motley paintings on the walls representing religious matters, such as “Purgatory,” “Hell,” “The Last Judgment,” “The Death of the Just,” and “The Death of the Sinner.”\nAt the back of the room, fastened in a splendid and elegant framework, in the Renaissance style, possibly by Arévalo, is a glass case in which are seen the figures of two old women. The inscription on this reads: “Our Lady of Peace and Prosperous Voyages, who is worshiped in Antipolo, visiting in the disguise of a beggar the holy and renowned Capitana Inez during her sickness.”[1] While the work reveals little taste or art, yet it possesses in compensation an extreme realism, for to judge from the yellow and bluish tints of her face the sick woman seems to be already a decaying corpse, and the glasses and other objects, accompaniments of long illness, are so minutely reproduced that even their contents may be distinguished. In looking at these pictures, which excite the appetite and inspire gay bucolic ideas, one may perhaps be led to think that the malicious host is well acquainted with the characters of the majority of those who are to sit at his table and that, in order to conceal his own way of thinking, he has hung from the ceiling costly Chinese lanterns; bird-cages without birds; red, green, and blue globes of frosted glass; faded air-plants; and dried and inflated fishes, which they call botetes. The view is closed on the side of the river by curious wooden arches, half Chinese and half European, affording glimpses of a terrace with arbors and bowers faintly lighted by paper lanterns of many colors.\nIn the sala, among massive mirrors and gleaming chandeliers, the guests are assembled. Here, on a raised platform, stands a grand piano of great price, which tonight has the additional virtue of not being played upon. Here, hanging on the wall, is an oil-painting of a handsome man in full dress, rigid, erect, straight as the tasseled cane he holds in his stiff, ring-covered fingers—the whole seeming to say, “Ahem! See how well dressed and how dignified I am!” The furnishings of the room are elegant and perhaps uncomfortable and unhealthful, since the master of the house would consider not so much the comfort and health of his guests as his own ostentation, “A terrible thing is dysentery,” he would say to them, “but you are sitting in European chairs and that is something you don’t find every day.”\nThis room is almost filled with people, the men being separated from the women as in synagogues and Catholic churches. The women consist of a number of Filipino and Spanish maidens, who, when they open their mouths to yawn, instantly cover them with their fans and who murmur only a few words to each other, any conversation ventured upon dying out in monosyllables like the sounds heard in a house at night, sounds made by the rats and lizards. Is it perhaps the different likenesses of Our Lady hanging on the walls that force them to silence and a religious demeanor or is it that the women here are an exception?\nA cousin of Capitan Tiago, a sweet-faced old woman, who speaks Spanish quite badly, is the only one receiving the ladies. To offer to the Spanish ladies a plate of cigars and buyos, to extend her hand to her countrywomen to be kissed, exactly as the friars do,—this is the sum of her courtesy, her policy. The poor old lady soon became bored, and taking advantage of the noise of a plate breaking, rushed precipitately away, muttering, “Jesús! Just wait, you rascals!” and failed to reappear.\nThe men, for their part, are making more of a stir. Some cadets in one corner are conversing in a lively manner but in low tones, looking around now and then to point out different persons in the room while they laugh more or less openly among themselves. In contrast, two foreigners dressed in white are promenading silently from one end of the room to the other with their hands crossed behind their backs, like the bored passengers on the deck of a ship. All the interest and the greatest animation proceed from a group composed of two priests, two civilians, and a soldier who are seated around a small table on which are seen bottles of wine and English biscuits.\nThe soldier, a tall, elderly lieutenant with an austere countenance—a Duke of Alva straggling behind in the roster of the Civil Guard—talks little, but in a harsh, curt way. One of the priests, a youthful Dominican friar, handsome, graceful, polished as the gold-mounted eyeglasses he wears, maintains a premature gravity. He is the curate of Binondo and has been in former years a professor in the college of San Juan de Letran,[2] where he enjoyed the reputation of being a consummate dialectician, so much so that in the days when the sons of Guzman[3] still dared to match themselves in subtleties with laymen, the able disputant B. de Luna had never been able either to catch or to confuse him, the distinctions made by Fray Sibyla leaving his opponent in the situation of a fisherman who tries to catch eels with a lasso. The Dominican says little, appearing to weigh his words.\nQuite in contrast, the other priest, a Franciscan, talks much and gesticulates more. In spite of the fact that his hair is beginning to turn gray, he seems to be preserving[6] well his robust constitution, while his regular features, his rather disquieting glance, his wide jaws and herculean frame give him the appearance of a Roman noble in disguise and make us involuntarily recall one of those three monks of whom Heine tells in his “Gods in Exile,” who at the September equinox in the Tyrol used to cross a lake at midnight and each time place in the hand of the poor boatman a silver piece, cold as ice, which left him full of terror.[4] But Fray Damaso is not so mysterious as they were. He is full of merriment, and if the tone of his voice is rough like that of a man who has never had occasion to correct himself and who believes that whatever he says is holy and above improvement, still his frank, merry laugh wipes out this disagreeable impression and even obliges us to pardon his showing to the room bare feet and hairy legs that would make the fortune of a Mendieta in the Quiapo fairs.[5]\nOne of the civilians is a very small man with a black beard, the only thing notable about him being his nose, which, to judge from its size, ought not to belong to him. The other is a rubicund youth, who seems to have arrived but recently in the country. With him the Franciscan is carrying on a lively discussion.\n“You’ll see,” the friar was saying, “when you’ve been here a few months you’ll be convinced of what I say. It’s one thing to govern in Madrid and another to live in the Philippines.”\n“But—”\n“I, for example,” continued Fray Damaso, raising his voice still higher to prevent the other from speaking, “I, for example, who can look back over twenty-three years of bananas and morisqueta, know whereof I speak. Don’t come at me with theories and fine speeches, for I know the Indian.[6] Mark well that the moment I arrived in the country I was assigned to a toxin, small it is true, but especially devoted to agriculture. I didn’t understand Tagalog very well then, but I was, soon confessing the women, and we understood one another and they came to like me so well that three years later, when I was transferred to another and larger town, made vacant by the death of the native curate, all fell to weeping, they heaped gifts upon me, they escorted me with music—”\n“But that only goes to show—”\n“Wait, wait! Don’t be so hasty! My successor remained a shorter time, and when he left he had more attendance, more tears, and more music. Yet he had been more given to whipping and had raised the fees in the parish to almost double.”\n“But you will allow me—”\n“But that isn’t all. I stayed in the town of San Diego twenty years and it has been only a few months since I left it.”\nHere he showed signs of chagrin.\n“Twenty years, no one can deny, are more than sufficient to get acquainted with a town. San Diego has a population of six thousand souls and I knew every inhabitant as well as if I had been his mother and wet-nurse. I knew in which foot this one was lame, where the shoe pinched that one, who was courting that girl, what affairs she had had and with whom, who was the real father of the child, and so on—for I was the confessor of every last one, and they took care not to fail in their duty. Our host, Santiago, will tell you whether I am speaking the truth, for he has a lot of land there and that was where we first became friends. Well then, you may see what the Indian is: when I left I was escorted by only a few old women and some of the tertiary brethren—and that after I had been there twenty years!”\n“But I don’t see what that has to do with the abolition of the tobacco monopoly,”[7] ventured the rubicund youth, taking advantage of the Franciscan’s pausing to drink a glass of sherry.\nFray Damaso was so greatly surprised that he nearly let his glass fall. He remained for a moment staring fixedly at the young man.\n“What? How’s that?” he was finally able to exclaim in great wonderment. “Is it possible that you don’t see it as clear as day? Don’t you see, my son, that all this proves plainly that the reforms of the ministers are irrational?”\nIt was now the youth’s turn to look perplexed. The lieutenant wrinkled his eyebrows a little more and the small man nodded toward Fray Damaso equivocally. The Dominican contented himself with almost turning his back on the whole group.\n“Do you really believe so?” the young man at length asked with great seriousness, as he looked at the friar with curiosity.\n“Do I believe so? As I believe the Gospel! The Indian is so indolent!”\n“Ah, pardon me for interrupting you,” said the young man, lowering his voice and drawing his chair a little closer, “but you have said something that awakens all my interest. Does this indolence actually, naturally, exist among the natives or is there some truth in what a foreign traveler says: that with this indolence we excuse our own, as well as our backwardness and our colonial system. He referred to other colonies whose inhabitants belong to the same race—”\n[9]“Bah, jealousy! Ask Señor Laruja, who also knows this country. Ask him if there is any equal to the ignorance and indolence of the Indian.”\n“It’s true,” affirmed the little man, who was referred to as Señor Laruja. “In no part of the world can you find any one more indolent than the Indian, in no part of the world.”\n“Nor more vicious, nor more ungrateful!”\n“Nor more unmannerly!”\nThe rubicund youth began to glance about nervously. “Gentlemen,” he whispered, “I believe that we are in the house of an Indian. Those young ladies—”\n“Bah, don’t be so apprehensive! Santiago doesn’t consider himself an Indian—and besides, he’s not here. And what if he were! These are the nonsensical ideas of the newcomers. Let a few months pass and you will change your opinion, after you have attended a lot of fiestas and bailúhan, slept on cots, and eaten your fill of tinola.”\n“Ah, is this thing that you call tinola a variety of lotus which makes people—er—forgetful?”\n“Nothing of the kind!” exclaimed Fray Damaso with a smile. “You’re getting absurd. Tinola is a stew of chicken and squash. How long has it been since you got here?”\n“Four days,” responded the youth, rather offended.\n“Have you come as a government employee?”\n“No, sir, I’ve come at my own expense to study the country.”\n“Man, what a rare bird!” exclaimed Fray Damaso, staring at him with curiosity. “To come at one’s own expense and for such foolishness! What a wonder! When there are so many books! And with two fingerbreadths of forehead! Many have written books as big as that! With two fingerbreadths of forehead!”\nThe Dominican here brusquely broke in upon the conversation. “Did your Reverence, Fray Damaso, say that [10]you had been twenty years in the town of San Diego and that you had left it? Wasn’t your Reverence satisfied with the town?”\nAt this question, which was put in a very natural and almost negligent tone, Fray Damaso suddenly lost all his merriment and stopped laughing. “No!” he grunted dryly, and let himself back heavily against the back of his chair.\nThe Dominican went on in a still more indifferent tone. “It must be painful to leave a town where one has been for twenty years and which he knows as well as the clothes he wears. I certainly was sorry to leave Kamiling and that after I had been there only a few months. But my superiors did it for the good of the Orders for my own good.”\nFray Damaso, for the first time that evening, seemed to be very thoughtful. Suddenly he brought his fist down on the arm of his chair and with a heavy breath exclaimed: “Either Religion is a fact or it is not! That is, either the curates are free or they are not! The country is going to ruin, it is lost!” And again he struck the arm of his chair.\nEverybody in the sala turned toward the group with astonished looks. The Dominican raised his head to stare at the Franciscan from under his glasses. The two foreigners paused a moment, stared with an expression of mingled severity and reproof, then immediately continued their promenade.\n“He’s in a bad humor because you haven’t treated him with deference,” murmured Señor Laruja into the ear of the rubicund youth.\n“What does your Reverence mean? What’s the trouble?” inquired the Dominican and the lieutenant at the same time, but in different tones.\n“That’s why so many calamities come! The ruling powers support heretics against the ministers of God!” continued the Franciscan, raising his heavy fists.\n“What do you mean?” again inquired the frowning lieutenant, half rising from his chair.\n“What do I mean?” repeated Fray Damaso, raising his voice and facing the lieutenant. “I’ll tell you what I mean. I, yes I, mean to say that when a priest throws out of his cemetery the corpse of a heretic, no one, not even the King himself, has any right to interfere and much less to impose any punishment! But a little General—a little General Calamity—”\n“Padre, his Excellency is the Vice-Regal Patron!” shouted the soldier, rising to his feet.\n“Excellency! Vice-Regal Patron! What of that!” retorted the Franciscan, also rising. “In other times he would have been dragged down a staircase as the religious orders once did with the impious Governor Bustamente.[8] Those were indeed the days of faith.”\n“I warn you that I can’t permit this! His Excellency represents his Majesty the King!”\n“King or rook! What difference does that make? For us there is no king other than the legitimate[9]—”\n“Halt!” shouted the lieutenant in a threatening tone, as if he were commanding his soldiers. “Either you withdraw what you have said or tomorrow I will report it to his Excellency!”\n“Go ahead—right now—go on!” was the sarcastic [12]rejoinder of Fray Damaso as he approached the officer with clenched fists. “Do you think that because I wear the cloth, I’m afraid? Go now, while I can lend you my carriage!”\nThe dispute was taking a ludicrous turn, but fortunately the Dominican intervened. “Gentlemen,” he began in an authoritative tone and with the nasal twang that so well becomes the friars, “you must not confuse things or seek for offenses where there are none. We must distinguish in the words of Fray Damaso those of the man from those of the priest. The latter, as such, per se, can never give offense, because they spring from absolute truth, while in those of the man there is a secondary distinction to be made: those which he utters ab irato, those which he utters ex ore, but not in corde, and those which he does utter in corde. These last are the only ones that can really offend, and only according to whether they preexisted as a motive in mente, or arose solely per accidens in the heat of the discussion, if there really exist—”\n“But I, by accidens and for my own part, understand his motives, Padre Sibyla,” broke in the old soldier, who saw himself about to be entangled in so many distinctions that he feared lest he might still be held to blame. “I understand the motives about which your Reverence is going to make distinctions. During the absence of Padre Damaso from San Diego, his coadjutor buried the body of an extremely worthy individual—yes, sir, extremely worthy, for I had had dealings with him many times and had been entertained in his house. What if he never went to confession, what does that matter? Neither do I go to confession! But to say that he committed suicide is a lie, a slander! A man such as he was, who has a son upon whom he centers his affection and hopes, a man who has faith in God, who recognizes his duties to society, a just and honorable man, does not commit suicide. This much I will say and will refrain from expressing the rest of my thoughts here, so please your Reverence.”\n[13]Then, turning his back on the Franciscan, he went on: “Now then, this priest on his return to the town, after maltreating the poor coadjutor, had the corpse dug up and taken away from the cemetery to be buried I don’t know where. The people of San Diego were cowardly enough not to protest, although it is true that few knew of the outrage. The dead man had no relatives there and his only son was in Europe. But his Excellency learned of the affair and as he is an upright man asked for some punishment—and Padre Damaso was transferred to a better town. That’s all there is to it. Now your Reverence can make your distinctions.”\nSo saying, he withdrew from the group.\n“I’m sorry that I inadvertently brought up so delicate a subject,” said Padre Sibyla sadly. “But, after all, if there has been a gain in the change of towns—”\n“How is there to be a gain? And what of all the things that are lost in moving, the letters, and the—and everything that is mislaid?” interrupted Fray Damaso, stammering in the vain effort to control his anger.\nLittle by little the party resumed its former tranquillity. Other guests had come in, among them a lame old Spaniard of mild and inoffensive aspect leaning on the arm of an elderly Filipina, who was resplendent in frizzes and paint and a European gown. The group welcomed them heartily, and Doctor De Espadaña and his señora, the Doctora Doña Victorina, took their seats among our acquaintances. Some newspaper reporters and shopkeepers greeted one another and moved about aimlessly without knowing just what to do.\n“But can you tell me, Señor Laruja, what kind of man our host is?” inquired the rubicund youth. “I haven’t been introduced to him yet.”\n“They say that he has gone out. I haven’t seen him either.”\n“There’s no need of introductions here,” volunteered Fray Damaso. “Santiago is made of the right stuff.”\n“No, he’s not the man who invented gunpowder,”[10] added Laruja.\n“You too, Señor Laruja,” exclaimed Doña Victorina in mild reproach, as she fanned herself. “How could the poor man invent gunpowder if, as is said, the Chinese invented it centuries ago?”\n“The Chinese! Are you crazy?” cried Fray Damaso. “Out with you! A Franciscan, one of my Order, Fray What-do-you-call-him Savalls,[11] invented it in the—ah the seventh century!”\n“A Franciscan? Well, he must have been a missionary in China, that Padre Savalls,” replied the lady, who did not thus easily part from her beliefs.\n“Schwartz,[12] perhaps you mean, señora,” said Fray Sibyla, without looking at her.\n“I don’t know. Fray Damaso said a Franciscan and I was only repeating.”\n“Well, Savalls or Chevas, what does it matter? The difference of a letter doesn’t make him a Chinaman,” replied the Franciscan in bad humor.\n“And in the fourteenth century, not the seventh,” added the Dominican in a tone of correction, as if to mortify the pride of the other friar.\n“Well, neither does a century more or less make him a Dominican.”\n“Don’t get angry, your Reverence,” admonished Padre Sibyla, smiling. “So much the better that he did invent it so as to save his brethren the trouble.”\n“And did you say, Padre Sibyla, that it was in the fourteenth century?” asked Doña Victorina with great interest. “Was that before or after Christ?”\nFortunately for the individual questioned, two persons entered the room.\n [1] A similar picture is found in the convento at Antipolo.—Author’s note.\n[2] A school of secondary instruction conducted by the Dominican Fathers, by whom it was taken over in 1640. “It had its first beginning in the house of a pious Spaniard, called Juan Geronimo Guerrero, who had dedicated himself, with Christian piety, to gathering orphan boys in his house, where he raised, clothed, and sustained them, and taught them to read and to write, and much more, to live in the fear of God.”—Blair and Robertson, The Philippine Islands, Vol. XLV, p. 208.—TR.\n[3] The Dominican friars, whose order was founded by Dominic de Guzman.—TR.\n[4] In the story mentioned, the three monks were the old Roman god Bacchus and two of his satellites, in the disguise of Franciscan friars,—TR.\n[5] According to a note to the Barcelona edition of this novel, Mendieta was a character well known in Manila, doorkeeper at the Alcaldía, impresario of children’s theaters, director of a merry-go-round, etc.—TR.\n[6] See Glossary.\n[7] The “tobacco monopoly” was established during the administration of Basco de Vargas (1778–1787), one of the ablest governors Spain sent to the Philippines, in order to provide revenue for the local government and to encourage agricultural development. The operation of the monopoly, however, soon degenerated into a system of “graft” and petty abuse which bore heartily upon the natives (see Zuñiga’s Estadismo), and the abolition of it in 1881 was one of the heroic efforts made by the Spanish civil administrators to adjust the archaic colonial system to the changing conditions in the Archipelago.—TR.\n[8] As a result of his severity in enforcing the payment of sums due the royal treasury on account of the galleon trade, in which the religious orders were heavily interested, Governor Fernando de Bustillos Bustamente y Rueda met a violent death at the hands of a mob headed by friars, October 11, 1719. See Blair and Robertson, The Philippine Islands, Vol. XLIV; Montero y Vidal, Historia General de Filipinas, Vol. I, Chap. XXXV.—TR.\n[9] A reference to the fact that the clerical party in Spain refused to accept the decree of Ferdinand VII setting aside the Salic law and naming his daughter Isabella as his successor, and, upon the death of Ferdinand, supported the claim of the nearest male heir, Don Carlos de Bourbon, thus giving rise to the Carlist movement. Some writers state that severe measures had to be adopted to compel many of the friars in the Philippines to use the feminine pronoun in their prayers for the sovereign, just whom the reverend gentlemen expected to deceive not being explained.—TR.\n[10] An apothegm equivalent to the English, “He’ll never set any rivers on fire.”—TR.\n[11] The name of a Carlist leader in Spain.—TR.\n[12] A German Franciscan monk who is said to have invented gunpowder about 1330.\n Chapter II – Crisostomo Ibarra It was not two beautiful and well-gowned young women that attracted the attention of all, even including Fray Sibyla, nor was it his Excellency the Captain-General with his staff, that the lieutenant should start from his abstraction and take a couple of steps forward, or that Fray Damaso should look as if turned to stone; it was simply the original of the oil-painting leading by the hand a young man dressed in deep mourning.\n“Good evening, gentlemen! Good evening, Padre!” were the greetings of Capitan Tiago as he kissed the hands of the priests, who forgot to bestow upon him their benediction. The Dominican had taken off his glasses to stare at the newly arrived youth, while Fray Damaso was pale and unnaturally wide-eyed.\n“I have the honor of presenting to you Don Crisostomo Ibarra, the son of my deceased friend,” went on Capitan Tiago. “The young gentleman has just arrived from Europe and I went to meet him.”\nAt the mention of the name exclamations were heard. The lieutenant forgot to pay his respects to his host and approached the young man, looking him over from head to foot. The young man himself at that moment was exchanging the conventional greetings with all in the group, nor did there seem to be any thing extraordinary about him except his mourning garments in the center of that brilliantly lighted room. Yet in spite of them his remarkable stature, his features, and his movements breathed forth an air of healthy youthfulness in which both body and mind had equally developed. There might have been noticed in his frank, pleasant face some faint traces of Spanish blood showing through a beautiful brown color, slightly flushed at the cheeks as a result perhaps of his residence in cold countries.\n“What!” he exclaimed with joyful surprise, “the curate of my native town! Padre Damaso, my father’s intimate friend!”\nEvery look in the room was directed toward the Franciscan, who made no movement.\n“Pardon me, perhaps I’m mistaken,” added Ibarra, embarrassed.\n“You are not mistaken,” the friar was at last able to articulate in a changed voice, “but your father was never an intimate friend of mine.”\nIbarra slowly withdrew his extended hand, looking greatly surprised, and turned to encounter the gloomy gaze of the lieutenant fixed on him.\n“Young man, are you the son of Don Rafael Ibarra?” he asked.\nThe youth bowed. Fray Damaso partly rose in his chair and stared fixedly at the lieutenant.\n“Welcome back to your country! And may you be happier in it than your father was!” exclaimed the officer in a trembling voice. “I knew him well and can say that he was one of the worthiest and most honorable men in the Philippines.”\n“Sir,” replied Ibarra, deeply moved, “the praise you bestow upon my father removes my doubts about the manner of his death, of which I, his son, am yet ignorant.”\nThe eyes of the old soldier filled with tears and turning away hastily he withdrew. The young man thus found himself alone in the center of the room. His host having disappeared, he saw no one who might introduce him to the young ladies, many of whom were watching him with interest. After a few moments of hesitation he started toward them in a simple and natural manner.\n“Allow me,” he said, “to overstep the rules of strict etiquette. It has been seven years since I have been in my own country and upon returning to it I cannot suppress my admiration and refrain from paying my respects to its most precious ornaments, the ladies.”\nBut as none of them ventured a reply, he found himself obliged to retire. He then turned toward a group of men who, upon seeing him approach, arranged themselves in a semicircle.\n“Gentlemen,” he addressed them, “it is a custom in Germany, when a stranger finds himself at a function and there is no one to introduce him to those present, that he give his name and so introduce himself. Allow me to adopt this usage here, not to introduce foreign customs when our own are so beautiful, but because I find myself driven to it by necessity. I have already paid my respects to the skies and to the ladies of my native land; now I wish to greet its citizens, my fellow-countrymen. Gentlemen, my name is Juan Crisostomo Ibarra y Magsalin.”\nThe others gave their names, more or less obscure, and unimportant here.\n“My name is A———,” said one youth dryly, as he made a slight bow.\n“Then I have the honor of addressing the poet whose works have done so much to keep up my enthusiasm for my native land. It is said that you do not write any more, but I could not learn the reason.”\n“The reason? Because one does not seek inspiration in order to debase himself and lie. One writer has been imprisoned for having put a very obvious truth into verse. They may have called me a poet but they sha’n’t call me a fool.”\n“And may I enquire what that truth was?”\n“He said that the lion’s son is also a lion. He came very near to being exiled for it,” replied the strange youth, moving away from the group.\nA man with a smiling face, dressed in the fashion of the natives of the country, with diamond studs in his shirt-bosom, came up at that moment almost running. He went directly to Ibarra and grasped his hand, saying, “Señor Ibarra, I’ve been eager to make your acquaintance. Capitan Tiago is a friend of mine and I knew your respected father. I am known as Capitan Tinong and live in Tondo, where you will always be welcome. I hope that you will honor me with a visit. Come and dine with us tomorrow.” He smiled and rubbed his hands.\n“Thank you,” replied Ibarra, warmly, charmed with such amiability, “but tomorrow morning I must leave for San Diego.”\n“How unfortunate! Then it will be on your return.”\n“Dinner is served!” announced a waiter from the café La Campana, and the guests began to file out toward the table, the women, especially the Filipinas, with great hesitation.\n Chapter III – The Dinner  Jele, jele, bago quiere.[1]\n Fray Sibyla seemed to be very content as he moved along tranquilly with the look of disdain no longer playing about his thin, refined lips. He even condescended to speak to the lame doctor, De Espadaña, who answered in monosyllables only, as he was somewhat of a stutterer. The Franciscan was in a frightful humor, kicking at the chairs and even elbowing a cadet out of his way. The lieutenant was grave while the others talked vivaciously, praising the magnificence of the table. Doña Victorina, however, was just turning up her nose in disdain when she suddenly became as furious as a trampled serpent—the lieutenant had stepped on the train of her gown.\n“Haven’t you any eyes?” she demanded.\n“Yes, señora, two better than yours, but the fact is that I was admiring your frizzes,” retorted the rather ungallant soldier as he moved away from her.\nAs if from instinct the two friars both started toward the head of the table, perhaps from habit, and then, as might have been expected, the same thing happened that occurs with the competitors for a university position, who openly exalt the qualifications and superiority of their opponents, later giving to understand that just the contrary was meant, and who murmur and grumble when they do not receive the appointment.\n“For you, Fray Damaso.”\n“For you, Fray Sibyla.”\n“An older friend of the family—confessor of the deceased lady—age, dignity, and authority—”\n“Not so very old, either! On the other hand, you are the curate of the district,” replied Fray Damaso sourly, without taking his hand from the back of the chair.\n“Since you command it, I obey,” concluded Fray Sibyla, disposing himself to take the seat.\n“I don’t command it!” protested the Franciscan. “I don’t command it!”\nFray Sibyla was about to seat himself without paying any more attention to these protests when his eyes happened to encounter those of the lieutenant. According to clerical opinion in the Philippines, the highest secular official is inferior to a friar-cook: cedant arma togae, said Cicero in the Senate—cedant arma cottae, say the friars in the Philippines.[2]\nBut Fray Sibyla was a well-bred person, so he said, “Lieutenant, here we are in the world and not in the church. The seat of honor belongs to you.” To judge from the tone of his voice, however, even in the world it really did belong to him, and the lieutenant, either to keep out of trouble or to avoid sitting between two friars, curtly declined.\nNone of the claimants had given a thought to their host. Ibarra noticed him watching the scene with a smile of satisfaction.\n“How’s this, Don Santiago, aren’t you going to sit down with us?”\nBut all the seats were occupied; Lucullus was not to sup in the house of Lucullus.\n“Sit still, don’t get up!” said Capitan Tiago, placing his hand on the young man’s shoulder. “This fiesta is for the special purpose of giving thanks to the Virgin for your safe arrival. Oy! Bring on the tinola! I ordered tinola as you doubtless have not tasted any for so long a time.”\nA large steaming tureen was brought in. The Dominican, after muttering the benedicite, to which scarcely any one knew how to respond, began to serve the contents. But whether from carelessness or other cause, Padre Damaso received a plate in which a bare neck and a tough wing of chicken floated about in a large quantity of soup amid lumps of squash, while the others were eating legs and breasts, especially Ibarra, to whose lot fell the second joints. Observing all this, the Franciscan mashed up some pieces of squash, barely tasted the soup, dropped his spoon noisily, and roughly pushed his plate away. The Dominican was very busy talking to the rubicund youth.\n“How long have you been away from the country?” Laruja asked Ibarra.\n“Almost seven years.”\n“Then you have probably forgotten all about it.”\n“Quite the contrary. Even if my country does seem to have forgotten me, I have always thought about it.”\n“How do you mean that it has forgotten you?” inquired the rubicund youth.\n“I mean that it has been a year since I have received any news from here, so that I find myself a stranger who does not yet know how and when his father died.”\nThis statement drew a sudden exclamation from the lieutenant.\n“And where were you that you didn’t telegraph?” asked Doña Victorina. “When we were married we telegraphed to the Peñinsula.”[3]\n“Señora, for the past two years I have been in the northern part of Europe, in Germany and Russian Poland.”\nDoctor De Espadaña, who until now had not ventured upon any conversation, thought this a good opportunity to say something. “I—I knew in S-spain a P-pole from W-warsaw, c-called S-stadtnitzki, if I r-remember c-correctly. P-perhaps you s-saw him?” he asked timidly and almost blushingly.\n“It’s very likely,” answered Ibarra in a friendly manner, “but just at this moment I don’t recall him.”\n“B-but you c-couldn’t have c-confused him with any one else,” went on the Doctor, taking courage. “He was r-ruddy as gold and t-talked Spanish very b-badly.”\n“Those are good clues, but unfortunately while there I talked Spanish only in a few consulates.”\n“How then did you get along?” asked the wondering Doña Victorina.\n“The language of the country served my needs, madam.”\n“Do you also speak English?” inquired the Dominican, who had been in Hongkong, and who was a master of pidgin-English, that adulteration of Shakespeare’s tongue used by the sons of the Celestial Empire.\n“I stayed in England a year among people who talked nothing but English.”\n“Which country of Europe pleased you the most?” asked the rubicund youth.\n“After Spain, my second fatherland, any country of free Europe.”\n“And you who seem to have traveled so much, tell us what do you consider the most notable thing that you have seen?” inquired Laruja.\nIbarra appeared to reflect. “Notable—in what way?”\n“For example, in regard to the life of the people—the social, political, religious life—in general, in its essential features—as a whole.”\nIbarra paused thoughtfully before replying. “Frankly, I like everything in those people, setting aside the national pride of each one. But before visiting a country, I tried to familiarize myself with its history, its Exodus, if I may so speak, and afterwards I found everything quite natural. I have observed that the prosperity or misery of each people is in direct proportion to its liberties or its prejudices and, accordingly, to the sacrifices or the selfishness of its forefathers.”\n“And haven’t you observed anything more than that?” broke in the Franciscan with a sneer. Since the beginning of the dinner he had not uttered a single word, his whole attention having been taking up, no doubt, with the food. “It wasn’t worth while to squander your fortune to learn so trifling a thing. Any schoolboy knows that.”\nIbarra was placed in an embarrassing position, and the rest looked from one to the other as if fearing a disagreeable scene. He was about to say, “The dinner is nearly over and his Reverence is now satiated,” but restrained himself and merely remarked to the others, “Gentlemen, don’t be surprised at the familiarity with which our former curate treats me. He treated me so when I was a child, and the years seem to make no difference in his Reverence. I appreciate it, too, because it recalls the days when his Reverence visited our home and honored my father’s table.”\nThe Dominican glanced furtively at the Franciscan, who was trembling visibly. Ibarra continued as he rose from the table: “You will now permit me to retire, since, as I have just arrived and must go away tomorrow morning, there remain some important business matters for me to attend to. The principal part of the dinner is over and I drink but little wine and seldom touch cordials. Gentlemen, all for Spain and the Philippines!” Saying this, he drained his glass, which he had not before touched. The old lieutenant silently followed his example.\n“Don’t go!” whispered Capitan Tiago. “Maria Clara will be here. Isabel has gone to get her. The new curate of your town, who is a saint, is also coming.”\n“I’ll call tomorrow before starting. I’ve a very important visit to make now.” With this he went away.\nMeanwhile the Franciscan had recovered himself. “Do you see?” he said to the rubicund youth, at the same time flourishing his dessert spoon. “That comes from pride. They can’t stand to have the curate correct them. They even think that they are respectable persons. It’s the evil result of sending young men to Europe. The government ought to prohibit it.”\n“And how about the lieutenant?” Doña Victorina chimed in upon the Franciscan, “he didn’t get the frown off his face the whole evening. He did well to leave us so old and still only a lieutenant!” The lady could not forget the allusion to her frizzes and the trampled ruffles of her gown.\nThat night the rubicund youth wrote down, among other things, the following title for a chapter in his Colonial Studies: “Concerning the manner in which the neck and wing of a chicken in a friar’s plate of soup may disturb the merriment of a feast.” Among his notes there appeared these observations: “In the Philippines the most unnecessary person at a dinner is he who gives it, for they are quite capable of beginning by throwing the host into the street and then everything will go on smoothly. Under present conditions it would perhaps be a good thing not to allow the Filipinos to leave the country, and even not to teach them to read.”\n [1] “He says that he doesn’t want it when it is exactly what he does want.” An expression used in the mongrel Spanish-Tagalog ‘market language’ of Manila and Cavite, especially among the children,—somewhat akin to the English ‘sour grapes.’—TR.\n[2] Arms should yield to the toga (military to civil power). Arms should yield to the surplice (military to religious power),—TR.\n[3] For Peninsula, i.e., Spain. The change of n to ñ was common among ignorant Filipinos.—TR.\n Chapter IV – Heretic and Filibuster Ibarra stood undecided for a moment. The night breeze, which during those months blows cool enough in Manila, seemed to drive from his forehead the light cloud that had darkened it. He took off his hat and drew a deep breath. Carriages flashed by, public rigs moved along at a sleepy pace, pedestrians of many nationalities were passing. He walked along at that irregular pace which indicates thoughtful abstraction or freedom from care, directing his steps toward Binondo Plaza and looking about him as if to recall the place. There were the same streets and the identical houses with their white and blue walls, whitewashed, or frescoed in bad imitation of granite; the church continued to show its illuminated clock face; there were the same Chinese shops with their soiled curtains and their iron gratings, in one of which was a bar that he, in imitation of the street urchins of Manila, had twisted one night; it was still unstraightened. “How slowly everything moves,” he murmured as he turned into Calle Sacristia. The ice-cream venders were repeating the same shrill cry, “Sorbeteee!” while the smoky lamps still lighted the identical Chinese stands and those of the old women who sold candy and fruit.\n“Wonderful!” he exclaimed. “There’s the same Chinese who was here seven years ago, and that old woman—the very same! It might be said that tonight I’ve dreamed of a seven years’ journey in Europe. Good heavens, that pavement is still in the same unrepaired condition as when I left!” True it was that the stones of the sidewalk on the corner of San Jacinto and Sacristia were still loose.\nWhile he was meditating upon this marvel of the city’s stability in a country where everything is so unstable, a hand was placed lightly on his shoulder. He raised his head to see the old lieutenant gazing at him with something like a smile in place of the hard expression and the frown which usually characterized him.\n“Young man, be careful! Learn from your father!” was the abrupt greeting of the old soldier.\n“Pardon me, but you seem to have thought a great deal of my father. Can you tell me how he died?” asked Ibarra, staring at him.\n“What! Don’t you know about it?” asked the officer.\n“I asked Don Santiago about it, but he wouldn’t promise to tell me until tomorrow. Perhaps you know?”\n“I should say I do, as does everybody else. He died in prison!”\nThe young man stepped backward a pace and gazed searchingly at the lieutenant. “In prison? Who died in prison?”\n“Your father, man, since he was in confinement,” was the somewhat surprised answer.\n“My father—in prison—confined in a prison? What are you talking about? Do you know who my father was? Are you—?” demanded the young man, seizing the officer’s arm.\n“I rather think that I’m not mistaken. He was Don Rafael Ibarra.”\n“Yes, Don Rafael Ibarra,” echoed the youth weakly.\n“Well, I thought you knew about it,” muttered the soldier in a tone of compassion as he saw what was passing in Ibarra’s mind. “I supposed that you—but be brave! Here one cannot be honest and keep out of jail.”\n“I must believe that you are not joking with me,” replied Ibarra in a weak voice, after a few moments’ silence. “Can you tell me why he was in prison?”\nThe old man seemed to be perplexed. “It’s strange to me that your family affairs were not made known to you.”\n“His last letter, a year ago, said that I should not be uneasy if he did not write, as he was very busy. He charged me to continue my studies and—sent me his blessing.”\n“Then he wrote that letter to you just before he died. It will soon be a year since we buried him.”\n“But why was my father a prisoner?”\n“For a very honorable reason. But come with me to the barracks and I’ll tell you as we go along. Take my arm.”\nThey moved along for some time in silence. The elder seemed to be in deep thought and to be seeking inspiration from his goatee, which he stroked continually.\n“As you well know,” he began, “your father was the richest man in the province, and while many loved and respected him, there were also some who envied and hated him. We Spaniards who come to the Philippines are unfortunately not all we ought to be. I say this as much on account of one of your ancestors as on account of your father’s enemies. The continual changes, the corruption in the higher circles, the favoritism, the low cost and the shortness of the journey, are to blame for it all. The worst characters of the Peninsula come here, and even if a good man does come, the country soon ruins him. So it was that your father had a number of enemies among the curates and other Spaniards.”\nHere he hesitated for a while. “Some months after your departure the troubles with Padre Damaso began, but I am unable to explain the real cause of them. Fray Damaso accused him of not coming to confession, although he had not done so formerly and they had nevertheless been good friends, as you may still remember. Moreover, Don Rafael was a very upright man, more so than many of those who regularly attend confession and than the confessors themselves. He had framed for himself a rigid morality and often said to me, when he talked of these troubles, ‘Señor Guevara, do you believe that God will pardon any crime, a murder for instance, solely by a man’s telling it to a priest—a man after all and one whose duty it is to keep quiet about it—by his fearing that he will roast in hell as a penance—by being cowardly and certainly shameless into the bargain? I have another conception of God,’ he used to say, ‘for in my opinion one evil does not correct another, nor is a crime to be expiated by vain lamentings or by giving alms to the Church. Take this example: if I have killed the father of a family, if I have made of a woman a sorrowing widow and destitute orphans of some happy children, have I satisfied eternal Justice by letting myself be hanged, or by entrusting my secret to one who is obliged to guard it for me, or by giving alms to priests who are least in need of them, or by buying indulgences and lamenting night and day? What of the widow and the orphans? My conscience tells me that I should try to take the place of him whom I killed, that I should dedicate my whole life to the welfare of the family whose misfortunes I caused. But even so, who can replace the love of a husband and a father?’ Thus your father reasoned and by this strict standard of conduct regulated all his actions, so that it can be said that he never injured anybody. On the contrary, he endeavored by his good deeds to wipe out some injustices which he said your ancestors had committed. But to get back to his troubles with the curate—these took on a serious aspect. Padre Damaso denounced him from the pulpit, and that he did not expressly name him was a miracle, since anything might have been expected of such a character. I foresaw that sooner or later the affair would have serious results.”\nAgain the old lieutenant paused. “There happened to be wandering about the province an ex-artilleryman who has been discharged from the army on account of his stupidity and ignorance. As the man had to live and he was not permitted to engage in manual labor, which would injure our prestige, he somehow or other obtained a position as collector of the tax on vehicles. The poor devil had no education at all, a fact of which the natives soon became aware, as it was a marvel for them to see a Spaniard who didn’t know how to read and write. Every one ridiculed him and the payment of the tax was the occasion of broad smiles. He knew that he was an object of ridicule and this tended to sour his disposition even more, rough and bad as it had formerly been. They would purposely hand him the papers upside down to see his efforts to read them, and wherever he found a blank space he would scribble a lot of pothooks which rather fitly passed for his signature. The natives mocked while they paid him. He swallowed his pride and made the collections, but was in such a state of mind that he had no respect for any one. He even came to have some hard words with your father.\n“One day it happened that he was in a shop turning a document over and over in the effort to get it straight when a schoolboy began to make signs to his companions and to point laughingly at the collector with his finger. The fellow heard the laughter and saw the joke reflected in the solemn faces of the bystanders. He lost his patience and, turning quickly, started to chase the boys, who ran away shouting ba, be, bi, bo, bu.[1] Blind with rage and unable to catch them, he threw his cane and struck one of the boys on the head, knocking him down. He ran up and began to kick the fallen boy, and none of those who had been laughing had the courage to interfere. Unfortunately, your father happened to come along just at that time. He ran forward indignantly, caught the collector by the arm, and reprimanded him severely. The artilleryman, who was no doubt beside himself with rage, raised his hand, but your father was too quick for him, and with the strength of a descendant of the Basques—some say that he struck him, others that he merely pushed him, but at any rate the man staggered and fell a little way off, striking his head against a stone. Don Rafael quietly picked the wounded boy up and carried him to the town hall. The artilleryman bled freely from the mouth and died a few moments later without recovering consciousness.\n“As was to be expected, the authorities intervened and arrested your father. All his hidden enemies at once rose up and false accusations came from all sides. He was accused of being a heretic and a filibuster. To be a heretic is a great danger anywhere, but especially so at that time when the province was governed by an alcalde who made a great show of his piety, who with his servants used to recite his rosary in the church in a loud voice, perhaps that all might hear and pray with him. But to be a filibuster is worse than to be a heretic and to kill three or four tax-collectors who know how to read, write, and attend to business. Every one abandoned him, and his books and papers were seized. He was accused of subscribing to El Correo de Ultramar, and to newspapers from Madrid, of having sent you to Germany, of having in his possession letters and a photograph of a priest who had been legally executed, and I don’t know what not. Everything served as an accusation, even the fact that he, a descendant of Peninsulars, wore a camisa. Had it been any one but your father, it is likely that he would soon have been set free, as there was a physician who ascribed the death of the unfortunate collector to a hemorrhage. But his wealth, his confidence in the law, and his hatred of everything that was not legal and just, wrought his undoing. In spite of my repugnance to asking for mercy from any one, I applied personally to the Captain-General—the predecessor of our present one—and urged upon him that there could not be anything of the filibuster about a man who took up with all the Spaniards, even the poor emigrants, and gave them food and shelter, and in whose veins yet flowed the generous blood of Spain. It was in vain that I pledged my life and swore by my poverty and my military honor. I succeeded only in being coldly listened to and roughly sent away with the epithet of chiflado.”[2]\nThe old man paused to take a deep breath, and after noticing the silence of his companion, who was listening with averted face, continued: “At your father’s request I prepared the defense in the case. I went first to the celebrated Filipino lawyer, young A———, but he refused to take the case. ‘I should lose it,’ he told me, ‘and my defending him would furnish the motive for another charge against him and perhaps one against me. Go to Señor M———, who is a forceful and fluent speaker and a Peninsular of great influence.’ I did so, and the noted lawyer took charge of the case, and conducted it with mastery and brilliance. But your father’s enemies were numerous, some of them hidden and unknown. False witnesses abounded, and their calumnies, which under other circumstances would have melted away before a sarcastic phrase from the defense, here assumed shape and substance. If the lawyer succeeded in destroying the force of their testimony by making them contradict each other and even perjure themselves, new charges were at once preferred. They accused him of having illegally taken possession of a great deal of land and demanded damages. They said that he maintained relations with the tulisanes in order that his crops and animals might not be molested by them. At last the case became so confused that at the end of a year no one understood it. The alcalde had to leave and there came in his place one who had the reputation of being honest, but unfortunately he stayed only a few months, and his successor was too fond of good horses.\n“The sufferings, the worries, the hard life in the prison, or the pain of seeing so much ingratitude, broke your father’s iron constitution and he fell ill with that malady which only the tomb can cure. When the case was almost finished and he was about to be acquitted of the charge of being an enemy of the fatherland and of being the murderer of the tax-collector, he died in the prison with no one at his side. I arrived just in time to see him breathe his last.”\nThe old lieutenant became silent, but still Ibarra said nothing. They had arrived meanwhile at the door of the barracks, so the soldier stopped and said, as he grasped the youth’s hand, “Young man, for details ask Capitan Tiago. Now, good night, as I must return to duty and see that all’s well.”\nSilently, but with great feeling, Ibarra shook the lieutenant’s bony hand and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared. Then he turned slowly and signaled to a passing carriage. “To Lala’s Hotel,” was the direction he gave in a scarcely audible voice.\n“This fellow must have just got out of jail,” thought the cochero as he whipped up his horses.\n [1] The syllables which constitute the first reading lesson in Spanish primers.—TR.\n[2] A Spanish colloquial term (“cracked”), applied to a native of Spain who was considered to be mentally unbalanced from too long residence in the islands,—TR.\n Chapter V – A Star in a Dark Night Ibarra went to his room, which overlooked the river, and dropping into a chair gazed out into the vast expanse of the heavens spread before him through the open window. The house on the opposite bank was profusely lighted, and gay strains of music, largely from stringed instruments, were borne across the river even to his room.\nIf the young man had been less preoccupied, if he had had more curiosity and had cared to see with his opera glasses what was going on in that atmosphere of light, he would have been charmed with one of those magical and fantastic spectacles, the like of which is sometimes seen in the great theaters of Europe. To the subdued strains of the orchestra there seems to appear in the midst of a shower of light, a cascade of gold and diamonds in an Oriental setting, a deity wrapped in misty gauze, a sylph enveloped in a luminous halo, who moves forward apparently without touching the floor. In her presence the flowers bloom, the dance awakens, the music bursts forth, and troops of devils, nymphs, satyrs, demons, angels, shepherds and shepherdesses, dance, shake their tambourines, and whirl about in rhythmic evolutions, each one placing some tribute at the feet of the goddess. Ibarra would have seen a beautiful and graceful maiden, clothed in the picturesque garments of the daughters of the Philippines, standing in the center Of a semicircle made up of every class of people, Chinese, Spaniards, Filipinos, soldiers, curates, old men and young, all gesticulating and moving about in a lively manner. Padre Damaso stood at the side of the beauty, smiling like one especially blessed. Fray Sibyla—yes, Fray Sibyla himself—was talking to her. Doña Victorina was arranging in the magnificent hair of the maiden a string of pearls and diamonds which threw out all the beautiful tints of the rainbow. She was white, perhaps too much so, and whenever she raised her downcast eyes there shone forth a spotless soul. When she smiled so as to show her small white teeth the beholder realized that the rose is only a flower and ivory but the elephant’s tusk. From out the filmy piña draperies around her white and shapely neck there blinked, as the Tagalogs say, the bright eyes of a collar of diamonds. One man only in all the crowd seemed insensible to her radiant influence—a young Franciscan, thin, wasted, and pale, who watched her from a distance, motionless as a statue and scarcely breathing.\nBut Ibarra saw nothing of all this—his eyes were fixed on other things. A small space was enclosed by four bare and grimy walls, in one of which was an iron grating. On the filthy and loathsome floor was a mat upon which an old man lay alone in the throes of death, an old man breathing with difficulty and turning his head from side to side as amid his tears he uttered a name. The old man was alone, but from time to time a groan or the rattle of a chain was heard on the other side of the wall. Far away there was a merry feast, almost an orgy; a youth was laughing, shouting, and pouring wine upon the flowers amid the applause and drunken laughter of his companions. The old man had the features of his father, the youth was himself, and the name that the old man uttered with tears was his own name! This was what the wretched young man saw before him. The lights in the house opposite were extinguished, the music and the noises ceased, but Ibarra still heard the anguished cry of his father calling upon his son in the hour of his death.\nSilence had now blown its hollow breath over the city, and all things seemed to sleep in the embrace of nothingness. The cock-crow alternated with the strokes of the clocks in the church towers and the mournful cries of the weary [35]sentinels. A waning moon began to appear, and everything seemed to be at rest; even Ibarra himself, worn out by his sad thoughts or by his journey, now slept.\nOnly the young Franciscan whom we saw not so long ago standing motionless and silent in the midst of the gaiety of the ballroom slept not, but kept vigil. In his cell, with his elbow upon the window sill and his pale, worn cheek resting on the palm of his hand, he was gazing silently into the distance where a bright star glittered in the dark sky. The star paled and disappeared, the dim light of the waning moon faded, but the friar did not move from his place—he was gazing out over the field of Bagumbayan and the sleeping sea at the far horizon wrapped in the morning mist.\n Chapter VI – Capitan Tiago  Thy will be done on earth.\n While our characters are deep in slumber or busy with their breakfasts, let us turn our attention to Capitan Tiago. We have never had the honor of being his guest, so it is neither our right nor our duty to pass him by slightingly, even under the stress of important events.\nLow in stature, with a clear complexion, a corpulent figure and a full face, thanks to the liberal supply of fat which according to his admirers was the gift of Heaven and which his enemies averred was the blood of the poor, Capitan Tiago appeared to be younger than he really was; he might have been thought between thirty and thirty-five years of age. At the time of our story his countenance always wore a sanctified look; his little round head, covered with ebony-black hair cut long in front and short behind, was reputed to contain many things of weight; his eyes, small but with no Chinese slant, never varied in expression; his nose was slender and not at all inclined to flatness; and if his mouth had not been disfigured by the immoderate use of tobacco and buyo, which, when chewed and gathered in one cheek, marred the symmetry of his features, we would say that he might properly have considered himself a handsome man and have passed for such. Yet in spite of this bad habit he kept marvelously white both his natural teeth and also the two which the dentist furnished him at twelve pesos each.\nHe was considered one of the richest landlords in Binondo and a planter of some importance by reason of his estates in Pampanga and Laguna, principally in the town of San Diego, the income from which increased with each year. San Diego, on account of its agreeable baths, its famous cockpit, and his cherished memories of the place, was his favorite town, so that he spent at least two months of the year there. His holdings of real estate in the city were large, and it is superfluous to state that the opium monopoly controlled by him and a Chinese brought in large profits. They also had the lucrative contract of feeding the prisoners in Bilibid and furnished zacate to many of the stateliest establishments in Manila u through the medium of contracts, of course. Standing well with all the authorities, clever, cunning, and even bold in speculating upon the wants of others, he was the only formidable rival of a certain Perez in the matter of the farming-out of revenues and the sale of offices and appointments, which the Philippine government always confides to private persons. Thus, at the time of the events here narrated, Capitan Tiago was a happy man in so far as it is possible for a narrow-brained individual to be happy in such a land: he was rich, and at peace with God, the government, and men.\nThat he was at peace with God was beyond doubt,—almost like religion itself. There is no need to be on bad terms with the good God when one is prosperous on earth, when one has never had any direct dealings with Him and has never lent Him any money. Capitan Tiago himself had never offered any prayers to Him, even in his greatest difficulties, for he was rich and his gold prayed for him. For masses and supplications high and powerful priests had been created; for novenas and rosaries God in His infinite bounty had created the poor for the service of the rich—the poor who for a peso could be secured to recite sixteen mysteries and to read all the sacred books, even the Hebrew Bible, for a little extra. If at any time in the midst of pressing difficulties he needed celestial aid and had not at hand even a red Chinese taper, he would call upon his most adored saints, promising them many things for the purpose of putting them under obligation to him and ultimately convincing them of the righteousness of his desires.\nThe saint to whom he promised the most, and whose promises he was the most faithful in fulfilling, was the Virgin of Antipolo, Our Lady of Peace and Prosperous Voyages.[1] With many of the lesser saints he was not very punctual or even decent; and sometimes, after having his petitions granted, he thought no more about them, though of course after such treatment he did not bother them again, when occasion arose. Capitan Tiago knew that the calendar was full of idle saints who perhaps had nothing wherewith to occupy their time up there in heaven. Furthermore, to the Virgin of Antipolo he ascribed greater power and efficiency than to all the other Virgins combined, whether they carried silver canes, naked or richly clothed images of the Christ Child, scapularies, rosaries, or girdles. Perhaps this reverence was owing to the fact that she was a very strict Lady, watchful of her name, and, according to the senior sacristan of Antipolo, an enemy of photography. When she was angered she turned black as ebony, while the other Virgins were softer of heart and more indulgent. It is a well-known fact that some minds love an absolute monarch rather than a constitutional one, as witness Louis XIV and Louis XVI, Philip II and Amadeo I. This fact perhaps explains why infidel Chinese and even Spaniards may be seen kneeling in the famous sanctuary; what is not explained is why the priests run away with the money of the terrible Image, go to America, and get married there.\nIn the sala of Capitan Tiago’s house, that door, hidden by a silk curtain leads to a small chapel or oratory such as must be lacking in no Filipino home. There were placed his household gods—and we say “gods” because he was inclined to polytheism rather than to monotheism, which he had never come to understand. There could be seen images of the Holy Family with busts and extremities of ivory, glass eyes, long eyelashes, and curly blond hair—masterpieces of Santa Cruz sculpture. Paintings in oil by artists of Paco and Ermita[2] represented martyrdoms of saints and miracles of the Virgin; St. Lucy gazing at the sky and carrying in a plate an extra pair of eyes with lashes and eyebrows, such as are seen painted in the triangle of the Trinity or on Egyptian tombs; St. Pascual Bailon; St. Anthony of Padua in a guingón habit looking with tears upon a Christ Child dressed as a Captain-General with the three-cornered hat, sword, and boots, as in the children’s ball at Madrid that character is represented—which signified for Capitan Tiago that while God might include in His omnipotence the power of a Captain-General of the Philippines, the Franciscans would nevertheless play with Him as with a doll. There, might also be seen a St. Anthony the Abbot with a hog by his side, a hog that for the worthy Capitan was as miraculous as the saint himself, for which reason he never dared to refer to it as the hog, but as the creature of holy St. Anthony; a St. Francis of Assisi in a coffee-colored robe and with seven wings, placed over a St. Vincent who had only two but in compensation carried a trumpet; a St. Peter the Martyr with his head split open by the talibon of an evil-doer and held fast by a kneeling infidel, side by side with another St. Peter cutting off the ear of a Moro, Malchus[3] no doubt, who was gnawing his lips and writhing with pain, while a fighting-cock on a doric column crowed and flapped his wings—from all of which Capitan Tiago deduced that in order to be a saint it was just as well to smite as to be smitten.\nWho could enumerate that army of images and recount the virtues and perfections that were treasured there! A whole chapter would hardly suffice. Yet we must not pass over in silence a beautiful St. Michael of painted and gilded wood almost four feet high. The Archangel is biting his lower lip and with flashing eyes, frowning forehead, and rosy cheeks is grasping a Greek shield and brandishing in his right hand a Sulu kris, ready, as would appear from his attitude and expression, to smite a worshiper or any one else who might approach, rather than the horned and tailed devil that had his teeth set in his girlish leg.\nCapitan Tiago never went near this image from fear of a miracle. Had not other images, even those more rudely carved ones that issue from the carpenter shops of Paete,[4] many times come to life for the confusion and punishment of incredulous sinners? It is a well-known fact that a certain image of Christ in Spain, when invoked as a witness of promises of love, had assented with a movement of the head in the presence of the judge, and that another such image had reached out its right arm to embrace St. Lutgarda. And furthermore, had he not himself read a booklet recently published about a mimic sermon preached by an image of St. Dominic in Soriano? True, the saint had not said a single word, but from his movements it was inferred, at any rate the author of the booklet inferred, that he was announcing the end of the world.[5] Was it not reported, too, that the Virgin of Luta in the town of Lipa had one cheek swollen larger than the other and that there was mud on the borders of her gown? Does not this prove mathematically that the holy images also walk about without holding up their skirts and that they even suffer from the toothache, perhaps for our sake? Had he not seen with his own eyes, during the regular Good-Friday sermon, all the images of Christ move and bow their heads thrice in unison, thereby calling forth wails and cries from the women and other sensitive souls destined for Heaven? More? We ourselves have seen the preacher show to the congregation at the moment of the descent from the cross a handkerchief stained with blood, and were ourselves on the point of weeping piously, when, to the sorrow of our soul, a sacristan assured us that it was all a joke, that the blood was that of a chicken which had been roasted and eaten on the spot in spite of the fact that it was Good Friday—and the sacristan was fat! So Capitan Tiago, even though he was a prudent and pious individual, took care not to approach the kris of St. Michael. “Let’s take no chances,” he would say to himself, “I know that he’s an archangel, but I don’t trust him, no, I don’t trust him.”\nNot a year passed without his joining with an orchestra in the pilgrimage to the wealthy shrine of Antipolo. He paid for two thanksgiving masses of the many that make up the three novenas, and also for the days when there are no novenas, and washed himself afterwards in the famous bátis, or pool, where the sacred Image herself had bathed. Her votaries can even yet discern the tracks of her feet and the traces of her locks in the hard rock, where she dried them, resembling exactly those made by any woman who uses coconut-oil, and just as if her hair had been steel or diamonds and she had weighed a thousand tons. We should like to see the terrible Image once shake her sacred hair in the eyes of those credulous persons and put her foot upon their tongues or their heads. There at the very edge of the pool Capitan Tiago made it his duty to eat roast pig, sinigang of dalag with alibambang leaves, and other more or less appetizing dishes. The two masses would cost him over four hundred pesos, but it was cheap, after all, if one considered the glory that the Mother of the Lord would acquire from the pin-wheels, rockets, bombs, and mortars, and also the increased profits which, thanks to these masses, would come to one during the year.\nBut Antipolo was not the only theater of his ostentatious devotion. In Binondo, in Pampanga, and in the town of San Diego, when he was about to put up a fighting-cock with large wagers, he would send gold moneys to the curate for propitiatory masses and, just as the Romans consulted the augurs before a battle, giving food to the sacred fowls, so Capitan Tiago would also consult his augurs, with the modifications befitting the times and the new truths, tie would watch closely the flame of the tapers, the smoke from the incense, the voice of the priest, and from it all attempt to forecast his luck. It was an admitted fact that he lost very few wagers, and in those cases it was due to the unlucky circumstance that the officiating priest was hoarse, or that the altar-candles were few or contained too much tallow, or that a bad piece of money had slipped in with the rest. The warden of the Brotherhood would then assure him that such reverses were tests to which he was subjected by Heaven to receive assurance of his fidelity and devotion. So, beloved by the priests, respected by the sacristans, humored by the Chinese chandlers and the dealers in fireworks, he was a man happy in the religion of this world, and persons of discernment and great piety even claimed for him great influence in the celestial court.\nThat he was at peace with the government cannot be doubted, however difficult an achievement it may seem. Incapable of any new idea and satisfied with his modus vivendi, he was ever ready to gratify the desires of the last official of the fifth class in every one of the offices, to make presents of hams, capons, turkeys, and Chinese fruits at all seasons of the year. If he heard any one speak ill of the natives, he, who did not consider himself as such, would join in the chorus and speak worse of them; if any one aspersed the Chinese or Spanish mestizos, he would do the same, perhaps because he considered himself become a full-blooded Iberian. He was ever first to talk in favor of any new imposition of taxes, or special assessment, especially when he smelled a contract or a farming assignment behind it. He always had an orchestra ready for congratulating and serenading the governors, judges, and other officials on their name-days and birthdays, at the birth or death of a relative, and in fact at every variation from the usual monotony. For such occasions he would secure laudatory poems and hymns in which were celebrated “the kind and loving governor,” “the brave and courageous judge for whom there awaits in heaven the palm of the just,” with many other things of the same kind.\nHe was the president of the rich guild of mestizos in spite of the protests of many of them, who did not regard him as one of themselves. In the two years that he held this office he wore out ten frock coats, an equal number of high hats, and half a dozen canes. The frock coat and the high hat were in evidence at the Ayuntamiento, in the governor-general’s palace, and at military headquarters; the high hat and the frock coat might have been noticed in the cockpit, in the market, in the processions, in the Chinese shops, and under the hat and within the coat might have been seen the perspiring Capitan Tiago, waving his tasseled cane, directing, arranging, and throwing everything into disorder with marvelous activity and a gravity even more marvelous.\nSo the authorities saw in him a safe man, gifted with the best of dispositions, peaceful, tractable, and obsequious, who read no books or newspapers from Spain, although he spoke Spanish well. Indeed, they rather looked upon him with the feeling with which a poor student contemplates the worn-out heel of his old shoe, twisted by his manner of walking. In his case there was truth in both the Christian and profane proverbs beati pauperes spiritu and beati possidentes,[6] and there might well be applied to him that translation, according to some people incorrect, from the Greek, “Glory to God in the highest and peace to men of good-will on earth!” even though we shall see further along that it is not sufficient for men to have good-will in order to live in peace.\nThe irreverent considered him a fool, the poor regarded him as a heartless and cruel exploiter of misery and want, and his inferiors saw in him a despot and a tyrant. As to the women, ah, the women! Accusing rumors buzzed through the wretched nipa huts, and it was said that wails and sobs might be heard mingled with the weak cries of an infant. More than one young woman was pointed out by her neighbors with the finger of scorn: she had a downcast glance and a faded cheek. But such things never robbed him of sleep nor did any maiden disturb his peace. It was an old woman who made him suffer, an old woman who was his rival in piety and who had gained from many curates such enthusiastic praises and eulogies as he in his best days had never received.\nBetween Capitan Tiago and this widow, who had inherited from brothers and cousins, there existed a holy rivalry which redounded to the benefit of the Church as the competition among the Pampanga steamers then redounded to the benefit of the public. Did Capitan Tiago present to some Virgin a silver wand ornamented with emeralds and topazes? At once Doña Patrocinio had ordered another of gold set with diamonds! If at the time of the Naval procession[7] Capitan Tiago erected an arch with two façades, covered with ruffled cloth and decorated with mirrors, glass globes, and chandeliers, then Doña Patrocinio would have another with four facades, six feet higher, and more gorgeous hangings. Then he would fall back on his reserves, his strong point, his specialty—masses with bombs and fireworks; whereat Doña Patrocinia could only gnaw at her lips with her toothless gums, because, being exceedingly nervous, she could not endure the chiming of the bells and still less the explosions of the bombs. While he smiled in triumph, she would plan her revenge and pay the money of others to secure the best orators of the five Orders in Manila, the most famous preachers of the Cathedral, and even the Paulists,[8] to preach on the holy days upon profound theological subjects to the sinners who understood only the vernacular of the mariners. The partizans of Capitan Tiago would observe that she slept during the sermon; but her adherents would answer that the sermon was paid for in advance, and by her, and that in any affair payment was the prime requisite. At length, she had driven him from the field completely by presenting to the church three andas of gilded silver, each one of which cost her over three thousand pesos. Capitan Tiago hoped that the old woman would breathe her last almost any day, or that she would lose five or six of her lawsuits, so that he might be alone in serving God; but unfortunately the best lawyers of the* Real Audiencia* looked after her interests, and as to her health, there was no part of her that could be attacked by sickness; she seemed to be a steel wire, no doubt for the edification of souls, and she hung on in this vale of tears with the tenacity of a boil on the skin. Her adherents were secure in the belief that she would be canonized at her death and that Capitan Tiago himself would have to worship her at the altars—all of which he agreed to and cheerfully promised, provided only that she die soon.\nSuch was Capitan Tiago in the days of which we write. As for the past, he was the only son of a sugar-planter of Malabon, wealthy enough, but so miserly that he would not spend a cent to educate his son, for which reason the little Santiago had been the servant of a good Dominican, a worthy man who had tried to train him in all of good that he knew and could teach. When he had reached the happy stage of being known among his acquaintances as a logician, that is, when he began to study logic, the death of his protector, soon followed by that of his father, put an end to his studies and he had to turn his attention to business affairs. He married a pretty young woman of Santa Cruz, who gave him social position and helped him to make his fortune. Doña Pia Alba was not satisfied with buying and selling sugar, indigo, and coffee, but wished to plant and reap, so the newly-married couple bought land in San Diego. From this time dated their friendship with Padre Damoso and with Don Rafael Ibarra, the richest capitalist of the town.\nThe lack of an heir in the first six years of their wedded life made of that eagerness to accumulate riches almost a censurable ambition. Doña Pia was comely, strong, and healthy, yet it was in vain that she offered novenas and at the advice of the devout women of San Diego made a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Kaysaysay[9] in Taal, distributed alms to the poor, and danced at midday in May in the procession of the Virgin of Turumba[10] in Pakil. But it was all with no result until Fray Damaso advised her to go to Obando to dance in the fiesta of St. Pascual Bailon and ask him for a son. Now it is well known that there is in Obando a trinity which grants sons or daughters according to request—Our Lady of Salambaw, St. Clara, and St. Pascual. Thanks to this wise advice, Doña Pia soon recognized the signs of approaching motherhood. But alas! like the fisherman of whom Shakespeare tells in Macbeth, who ceased to sing when he had found a treasure, she at once lost all her mirthfulness, fell into melancholy, and was never seen to smile again. “Capriciousness, natural in her condition,” commented all, even Capitan Tiago. A puerperal fever put an end to her hidden grief, and she died, leaving behind a beautiful girl baby for whom Fray Damaso himself stood sponsor. As St. Pascual had not granted the son that was asked, they gave the child the name of Maria Clara, in honor of the Virgin of Salambaw and St. Clara, punishing the worthy St. Pascual with silence.\nThe little girl grew up under the care of her aunt Isabel, that good old lady of monkish urbanity whom we met at the beginning of the story. For the most part, her early life was spent in San Diego, on account of its healthful climate, and there Padre Damaso was devoted to her.\nMaria Clara had not the small eyes of her father; like her mother, she had eyes large, black, long-lashed, merry and smiling when she was playing but sad, deep, and pensive in moments of repose. As a child her hair was curly and almost blond, her straight nose was neither too pointed nor too flat, while her mouth with the merry dimples at the corners recalled the small and pleasing one of her mother, her skin had the fineness of an onion-cover and was white as cotton, according to her perplexed relatives, who found the traces of Capitan Tiago’s paternity in her small and shapely ears. Aunt Isabel ascribed her half-European features to the longings of Doña Pia, whom she remembered to have seen many times weeping before the image of St. Anthony. Another cousin was of the same opinion, differing only in the choice of the smut, as for her it was either the Virgin herself or St. Michael. A famous philosopher, who was the cousin of Capitan Tinong and who had memorized the “Amat,”[11] sought for the true explanation in planetary influences.\nThe idol of all, Maria Clara grew up amidst smiles and love. The very friars showered her with attentions when she appeared in the processions dressed in white, her abundant hair interwoven with tuberoses and sampaguitas, with two diminutive wings of silver and gold fastened on the back of her gown, and carrying in her hands a pair of white doves tied with blue ribbons. Afterwards, she would be so merry and talk so sweetly in her childish simplicity that the enraptured Capitan Tiago could do nothing but bless the saints of Obando and advise every one to purchase beautiful works of sculpture.\nIn southern countries the girl of thirteen or fourteen years changes into a woman as the bud of the night becomes a flower in the morning. At this period of change, so full of mystery and romance, Maria Clara was placed, by the advice of the curate of Binondo, in the nunnery of St. Catherine[12] in order to receive strict religious training from the Sisters. With tears she took leave of Padre Damaso and of the only lad who had been a friend of her childhood, Crisostomo Ibarra, who himself shortly afterward went away to Europe. There in that convent, which communicates with the world through double bars, even under the watchful eyes of the nuns, she spent seven years.\nEach having his own particular ends in view and knowing the mutual inclinations of the two young persons, Don Rafael and Capitan Tiago agreed upon the marriage of their children and the formation of a business partnership. This agreement, which was concluded some years after the younger Ibarra’s departure, was celebrated with equal joy by two hearts in widely separated parts of the world and under very different circumstances.\n [1] This celebrated Lady was first brought from Acapulco, Mexico, by Juan Niño de Tabora, when he came to govern the Philippines in 1626. By reason of her miraculous powers of allaying the storms she was carried back and forth in the state galleons on a number of voyages, until in 1672 she was formally installed in a church in the hills northeast of Manila, under the care of the Augustinian Fathers. While her shrine was building she is said to have appeared to the faithful in the top of a large breadfruit tree, which is known to the Tagalogs as “antipolo”; hence her name. Hers is the best known and most frequented shrine in the country, while she disputes with the Holy Child of Cebu the glory of being the wealthiest individual in the whole archipelago.\nThere has always existed a pious rivalry between her and the Dominicans’ Lady of the Rosary as to which is the patron saint of the Philippines, the contest being at times complicated by counterclaims on the part of St. Francis, although the entire question would seem to have been definitely settled by a royal decree, published about 1650, officially conferring that honorable post upon St. Michael the Archangel (San Miguel). A rather irreverent sketch of this celebrated queen of the skies appears in Chapter XI of Foreman’s The Philippine Islands.—TR.\n[2] Santa Cruz, Paco, and Ermita are districts of Manila, outside the Walled City.—TR.\n[3] John xviii. 10.\n[4] A town in Laguna Province, noted for the manufacture of furniture.—TR.\n[5] God grant that this prophecy may soon be fulfilled for the author of the booklet and all of us who believe it.

Her discovery, over two and a half centuries ago, is notable in that she was found in the sea during some fisheries, coming up in a drag-net with the fish. It is thought that this venerable image of the Filipinos may have been in some ship which was wrecked and that the currents carried her up to the coast, where she was found in the manner related.\n“The Indians, naturally credulous and for the most part quite superstitious, in spite of the advancements in civilization and culture, relate that she appeared afterwards in some trees, and in memory of these manifestations an arch representing them was erected at a short distance from the place where her sanctuary is now located.”—Buzeta and Bravo’s Diccionario, Madrid, 1850, but copied “with proper modifications for the times and the new truths” from Zuñiga’s Estadismo, which, though written in 1803 and not published until 1893, was yet used by later writers, since it was preserved in manuscript in the convent of the Augustinians in Manila, Buzeta and Bravo, as well as Zuñiga, being members of that order.\nSo great was the reverence for this Lady that the Acapulco galleons on their annual voyages were accustomed to fire salutes in her honor as they passed along the coast near her shrine.—Foreman. The Philippine Islands, quoting from the account of an eruption of Taal Volcano in 1749, by Fray Francisco Vencuchillo.\nThis Lady’s sanctuary, where she is still “enchanting” in her “eagle in half-relief,” stands out prominently on the hill above the town of Taal, plainly visible from Balayan Bay.—TR.\n[10] A Tagalog term meaning “to tumble,” or “to caper about,” doubtless from the actions of the Lady’s devotees.

Scarcely had the priest disappeared from the altar when the maiden expressed a desire for returning home, to the great surprise and displeasure of her good aunt, who believed her niece to be as pious and devoted to praying as a nun, at least. Grumbling and crossing herself, the good old lady rose. “The good Lord will forgive me, Aunt Isabel, since He must know the hearts of girls better than you do,” Maria Clara might have said to check the severe yet maternal chidings.\nAfter they had breakfasted, Maria Clara consumed her impatience in working at a silk purse while her aunt was trying to clean up the traces of the former night’s revelry by swinging a feather duster about. Capitan Tiago was busy looking over some papers. Every noise in the street, every carriage that passed, caused the maiden to tremble and quickened the beatings of her heart. Now she wished that she were back in the quiet convent among her friends; there she could have seen him without emotion and agitation! But was he not the companion of her infancy, had they not played together and even quarreled at times? The reason for all this I need not explain; if you, O reader, have ever loved, you will understand; and if you have not, it is useless for me to tell you, as the uninitiated do not comprehend these mysteries.\n“I believe, Maria, that the doctor is right,” said Capitan Tiago. “You ought to go into the country, for you are pale and need fresh air. What do you think of Malabon or San Diego?” At the mention of the latter place Maria Clara blushed like a poppy and was unable to answer.\n“You and Isabel can go at once to the convent to get your clothes and to say good-by to your friends,” he continued, without raising his head. “You will not stay there any longer.”\nThe girl felt the vague sadness that possesses the mind when we leave forever a place where we have been happy, but another thought softened this sorrow.\n“In four or five days, after you get some new clothes made, we’ll go to Malabon. Your godfather is no longer in San Diego. The priest that you may have noticed here last night, that young padre, is the new curate whom we have there, and he is a saint.”\n“I think that San Diego would be better, cousin,” observed Aunt Isabel. “Besides, our house there is better and the time for the fiesta draws near.”\nMaria Clara wanted to embrace her aunt for this speech, but hearing a carriage stop, she turned pale.\n“Ah, very true,” answered Capitan Tiago, and then in a different tone he exclaimed, “Don Crisostomo!”\nThe maiden let her sewing fall from her hands and wished to move but could not—a violent tremor ran through her body. Steps were heard on the stairway and then a fresh, manly voice. As if that voice had some magic power, the maiden controlled her emotion and ran to hide in the oratory among the saints. The two cousins laughed, and Ibarra even heard the noise of the door closing. Pale and breathing rapidly, the maiden pressed her beating heart and tried to listen. She heard his voice, that beloved voice that for so long a time she had heard only in her dreams he was asking for her! Overcome with joy, she kissed the nearest saint, which happened to be St. Anthony the Abbot, a saint happy in flesh and in wood, ever the object of pleasing temptations! Afterwards she sought the keyhole in order to see and examine him. She smiled, and when her aunt snatched her from that position she unconsciously threw her arms around the old lady’s neck and rained kisses upon her.\n“Foolish child, what’s the matter with you?” the old lady was at last able to say as she wiped a tear from her faded eyes. Maria Clara felt ashamed and covered her eyes with her plump arm.\n“Come on, get ready, come!” added the old aunt fondly. “While he is talking to your father about you. Come, don’t make him wait.” Like a child the maiden obediently followed her and they shut themselves up in her chamber.\nCapitan Tiago and Ibarra were conversing in a lively manner when Aunt Isabel appeared half dragging her niece, who was looking in every direction except toward the persons in the room.\nWhat said those two souls communicating through the language of the eyes, more perfect than that of the lips, the language given to the soul in order that sound may not mar the ecstasy of feeling? In such moments, when the thoughts of two happy beings penetrate into each other’s souls through the eyes, the spoken word is halting, rude, and weak—it is as the harsh, slow roar of the thunder compared with the rapidity of the dazzling lightning flash, expressing feelings already recognized, ideas already understood, and if words are made use of it is only because the heart’s desire, dominating all the being and flooding it with happiness, wills that the whole human organism with all its physical and psychical powers give expression to the song of joy that rolls through the soul. To the questioning glance of love, as it flashes out and then conceals itself, speech has no reply; the smile, the kiss, the sigh answer.\nSoon the two lovers, fleeing from the dust raised by Aunt Isabel’s broom, found themselves on the azotea where they could commune in liberty among the little arbors. What did they tell each other in murmurs that you nod your heads, O little red cypress flowers? Tell it, you who have fragrance in your breath and color on your lips. And thou, O zephyr, who learnest rare harmonies in the stillness of the dark night amid the hidden depths of our virgin forests! Tell it, O sunbeams, brilliant manifestation upon earth of the Eternal, sole immaterial essence in a material world, you tell it, for I only know how to relate prosaic commonplaces. But since you seem unwilling to do so, I am going to try myself.\nThe sky was blue and a fresh breeze, not yet laden with the fragrance of roses, stirred the leaves and flowers of the vines; that is why the cypresses, the orchids, the dried fishes, and the Chinese lanterns were trembling. The splash of paddles in the muddy waters of the river and the rattle of carriages and carts passing over the Binondo bridge came up to them distinctly, although they did not hear what the old aunt murmured as she saw where they were: “That’s better, there you’ll be watched by the whole neighborhood.” At first they talked nonsense, giving utterance only to those sweet inanities which are so much like the boastings of the nations of Europe—pleasing and honey-sweet at home, but causing foreigners to laugh or frown.\nShe, like a sister of Cain, was of course jealous and asked her sweetheart, “Have you always thought of me? Have you never forgotten me on all your travels in the great cities among so many beautiful women?”\nHe, too, was a brother of Cain, and sought to evade such questions, making use of a little fiction. “Could I forget you?” he answered as he gazed enraptured into her dark eyes. “Could I be faithless to my oath, my sacred oath? Do you remember that stormy night when you saw me weeping alone by the side of my dead mother and, drawing near to me, you put your hand on my shoulder, that hand which for so long a time you had not allowed me to touch, saying to me, ‘You have lost your mother while I never had one,’ and you wept with me? You loved her and she looked upon you as a daughter. Outside it rained and the lightning flashed, but within I seemed to hear music and to see a smile on the pallid face of the dead. Oh, that my parents were alive and might behold you now! I then caught your hand along with the hand of my mother and swore to love you and to make you happy, whatever fortune Heaven might have in store for me; and that oath, which has never weighed upon me as a burden, I now renew!\n“Could I forget you? The thought of you has ever been with me, strengthening me amid the dangers of travel, and has been a comfort to my soul’s loneliness in foreign lands. The thoughts of you have neutralized the lotus-effect of Europe, which erases from the memories of so many of our countrymen the hopes and misfortunes of our fatherland. In dreams I saw you standing on the shore at Manila, gazing at the far horizon wrapped in the warm light of the early dawn. I heard the slow, sad song that awoke in me sleeping affections and called back to the memory of my heart the first years of our childhood, our joys, our pleasures, and all that happy past which you gave life to while you were in our town. It seemed to me that you were the fairy, the spirit, the poetic incarnation of my fatherland, beautiful, unaffected, lovable, frank, a true daughter of the Philippines, that beautiful land which unites with the imposing virtues of the mother country, Spain, the admirable qualities of a young people, as you unite in your being all that is beautiful and lovely, the inheritance of both races” so indeed the love of you and that of my fatherland have become fused into one.\n“Could I forget you? Many times have I thought that I heard the sound of your piano and the accents of your voice. When in Germany, as I wandered at twilight in the woods, peopled with the fantastic creations of its poets and the mysterious legends of past generations, always I called upon your name, imagining that I saw you in the mists that rose from the depths of the valley, or I fancied that I heard your voice in the rustling of the leaves. When from afar I heard the songs of the peasants as they returned from their labors, it seemed to me that their tones harmonized with my inner voices, that they were singing for you, and thus they lent reality to my illusions and dreams. At times I became lost among the mountain paths and while the night descended slowly, as it does there, I would find myself still wandering, seeking my way among the pines and beeches and oaks. Then when some scattering rays of moonlight slipped down into the clear spaces left in the dense foliage, I seemed to see you in the heart of the forest as a dim, loving shade wavering about between the spots of light and shadow. If perhaps the nightingale poured forth his varied trills, I fancied it was because he saw you and was inspired by you.\n“Have I thought of you? The fever of love not only gave warmth to the snows but colored the ice! The beautiful skies of Italy with their clear depths reminded me of your eyes, its sunny landscape spoke to me of your smile; the plains of Andalusia with their scent-laden airs, peopled with oriental memories, full of romance and color, told me of your love! On dreamy, moonlit nights, while boating oil the Rhine, I have asked myself if my fancy did not deceive me as I saw you among the poplars on the banks, on the rocks of the Lorelei, or in the midst of the waters, singing in the silence of the night as if you were a comforting fairy maiden sent to enliven the solitude and sadness of those ruined castles!”\n“I have not traveled like you, so I know only your town and Manila and Antipolo,” she answered with a smile which showed that she believed all he said. “But since I said good-by to you and entered the convent, I have always thought of you and have only put you out of my mind when ordered to do so by my confessor, who imposed many penances upon me. I recalled our games and our quarrels when we were children. You used to pick up the most beautiful shells and search in the river for the roundest and smoothest pebbles of different colors that we might play games with them. You were very stupid and always lost, and by way of a forfeit I would slap you with the palm of my hand, but I always tried not to strike you hard, for I had pity on you. In those games you cheated much, even more than I did, and we used to finish our play in a quarrel. Do you remember that time when you became really angry at me? Then you made me suffer, but afterwards, when I thought of it in the convent, I smiled and longed for you so that we might quarrel again—so that we might once more make up. We were still children and had gone with your mother to bathe in the brook under the shade of the thick bamboo. On the banks grew many flowers and plants whose strange names you told me in Latin and Spanish, for you were even then studying in the Ateneo.[1] I paid no attention, but amused myself by running after the needle-like dragon-flies and the butterflies with their rainbow colors and tints of mother-of-pearl as they swarmed about among the flowers. Sometimes I tried to surprise them with my hands or to catch the little fishes that slipped rapidly about amongst the moss and stones in the edge of the water. Once you disappeared suddenly and when you returned you brought a crown of leaves and orange blossoms, which you placed upon my head, calling me Chloe. For yourself you made one of vines. But your mother snatched away my crown, and after mashing it with a stone mixed it with the gogo with which she was going to wash our heads. The tears came into your eyes and you said that she did not understand mythology. ‘Silly boy,’ your mother exclaimed, ‘you’ll see how sweet your hair will smell afterwards.’ I laughed, but you were offended and would not talk with me, and for the rest of the day appeared so serious that then I wanted to cry. On our way back to the town through the hot sun, I picked some sage leaves that grew beside the path and gave them to you to put in your hat so that you might not get a headache. You smiled and caught my hand, and we made up.”\nIbarra smiled with happiness as he opened his pocketbook and took from it a piece of paper in which were wrapped some dry, blackened leaves which gave off a sweet odor. “Your sage leaves,” he said, in answer to her inquiring look. “This is all that you have ever given me.”\nShe in turn snatched from her bosom a little pouch of white satin. “You must not touch this,” she said, tapping the palm of his hand lightly. “It’s a letter of farewell.”\n“The one I wrote to you before leaving?”\n“Have you ever written me any other, sir?”\n“And what did I say to you then?”\n“Many fibs, excuses of a delinquent debtor,” she answered smilingly, thus giving him to understand how sweet to her those fibs were. “Be quiet now and I’ll read it to you. I’ll leave out your fine phrases in order not to make a martyr of you.”\nRaising the paper to the height of her eyes so that the youth might not see her face, she began: “‘My’—but I’ll not read what follows that because it’s not true.”\nHer eyes ran along some lines.\n“‘My father wishes me to go away, in spite of all my pleadings. ‘You are a man now,’ he told me, ‘and you must think about your future and about your duties. You must learn the science of life, a thing which your fatherland cannot teach you, so that you may some day be useful to it. If you remain here in my shadow, in this environment of business affairs, you will not learn to look far ahead. The day in which you lose me you will find yourself like the plant of which our poet Baltazar tells: grown in the water, its leaves wither at the least scarcity of moisture and a moment’s heat dries it up. Don’t you understand? You are almost a young man, and yet you weep!’ These reproaches hurt me and I confessed that I loved you. My father reflected for a time in silence and then, placing his hand on my shoulder, said in a trembling voice, ‘Do you think that you alone know how to love, that your father does not love you, and that he will not feel the separation from you? It is only a short time since we lost your mother, and I must journey on alone toward old age, toward the very time of life when I would seek help and comfort from your youth, yet I accept my loneliness, hardly knowing whether I shall ever see you again. But you must think of other and greater things; the future lies open before you, while for me it is already passing behind; your love is just awakening, while mine is dying; fire burns in your blood, while the chill is creeping into mine. Yet you weep and cannot sacrifice the present for the future, useful as it may be alike to yourself and to your country.’ My father’s eyes filled with tears and I fell upon my knees at his feet, I embraced him, I begged his forgiveness, and I assured him that I was ready to set out—’”\nIbarra’s growing agitation caused her to suspend the reading, for he had grown pale and was pacing back and forth.\n“What’s the matter? What is troubling you?” she asked him.\n“You have almost made me forget that I have my duties, that I must leave at once for the town. Tomorrow is the day for commemorating the dead.”\nMaria Clara silently fixed her large dreamy eyes upon him for a few moments and then, picking some flowers, she said with emotion, “Go, I won’t detain you longer! In a few days we shall see each other again. Lay these flowers on the tomb of your parents.”\nA few moments later the youth descended the stairway accompanied by Capitan Tiago and Aunt Isabel, while Maria Clara shut herself up in the oratory.\n“Please tell Andeng to get the house ready, as Maria and Isabel are coming. A pleasant journey!” said Capitan Tiago as Ibarra stepped into the carriage, which at once started in the direction of the plaza of San Gabriel.\nAfterwards, by way of consolation, her father said to Maria Clara, who was weeping beside an image of the Virgin, “Come, light two candles worth two reals each, one to St. Roch,[2] and one to St. Raphael, the protector of travelers. Light the lamp of Our Lady of Peace and Prosperous Voyages, since there are so many tulisanes. It’s better to spend four reals for wax and six cuartos for oil now than to pay a big ransom later.”\n [1] The “Ateneo Municipal,” where the author, as well as nearly every other Filipino of note in the past generation, received his early education, was founded by the Jesuits shortly after their return to the islands in 1859.—TR.\n[2] The patron saint of Tondo, Manila’s Saint-Antoine. He is invoked for aid in driving away plagues,—TR.\n Chapter VIII – Recollections Ibarra’s carriage was passing through a part of the busiest district in Manila, the same which the night before had made him feel sad, but which by daylight caused him to smile in spite of himself. The movement in every part, so many carriages coming and going at full speed, the carromatas and calesas, the Europeans, the Chinese, the natives, each in his own peculiar costume, the fruit-venders, the money-changers, the naked porters, the grocery stores, the lunch stands and restaurants, the shops, and even the carts drawn by the impassive and indifferent carabao, who seems to amuse himself in carrying burdens while he patiently ruminates, all this noise and confusion, the very sun itself, the distinctive odors and the motley colors, awoke in the youth’s mind a world of sleeping recollections.\nThose streets had not yet been paved, and two successive days of sunshine filled them with dust which covered everything and made the passer-by cough while it nearly blinded him. A day of rain formed pools of muddy water, which at night reflected the carriage lights and splashed mud a distance of several yards away upon the pedestrians on the narrow sidewalks. And how many women have left their embroidered slippers in those waves of mud!\nThen there might have been seen repairing those streets the lines of convicts with their shaven heads, dressed in short-sleeved camisas and pantaloons that reached only to their knees, each with his letter and number in blue. On their legs were chains partly wrapped in dirty rags to ease the chafing or perhaps the chill of the iron. Joined two by two, scorched in the sun, worn out by the heat and fatigue, they were lashed and goaded by a whip in the hands of one of their own number, who perhaps consoled himself with this power of maltreating others. They were tall men with somber faces, which he had never seen brightened with the light of a smile. Yet their eyes gleamed when the whistling lash fell upon their shoulders or when a passer-by threw them the chewed and broken stub of a cigar, which the nearest would snatch up and hide in his salakot, while the rest remained gazing at the passers-by with strange looks.\nThe noise of the stones being crushed to fill the puddles and the merry clank of the heavy fetters on the swollen ankles seemed to remain with Ibarra. He shuddered as he recalled a scene that had made a deep impression on his childish imagination. It was a hot afternoon, and the burning rays of the sun fell perpendicularly upon a large cart by the side of which was stretched out one of those unfortunates, lifeless, yet with his eyes half opened. Two others were silently preparing a bamboo bier, showing no signs of anger or sorrow or impatience, for such is the character attributed to the natives: today it is you, tomorrow it will be I, they say to themselves. The people moved rapidly about without giving heed, women came up and after a look of curiosity continued unconcerned on their way—it was such a common sight that their hearts had become callous. Carriages passed, flashing back from their varnished sides the rays of the sun that burned in a cloudless sky. Only he, a child of eleven years and fresh from the country, was moved, and to him alone it brought bad dreams on the following night.\nThere no longer existed the useful and honored Puente de Barcas, the good Filipino pontoon bridge that had done its best to be of service in spite of its natural imperfections and its rising and falling at the caprice of the Pasig, which had more than once abused it and finally destroyed it. The almond trees in the plaza of San Gabriel[1] had not grown; they were still in the same feeble and stunted condition. The Escolta appeared less beautiful in spite of the fact that an imposing building with caryatids carved on its front now occupied the place of the old row of shops. The new Bridge of Spain caught his attention, while the houses on the right bank of the river among the clumps of bamboo and trees where the Escolta ends and the Isla de Romero begins, reminded him of the cool mornings when he used to pass there in a boat on his way to the baths of Uli-Uli.\nHe met many carriages, drawn by beautiful pairs of dwarfish ponies, within which were government clerks who seemed yet half asleep as they made their way to their offices, or military officers, or Chinese in foolish and ridiculous attitudes, or Gave friars and canons. In an elegant victoria he thought he recognized Padre Damaso, grave and frowning, but he had already passed. Now he was pleasantly greeted by Capitan Tinong, who was passing in a carretela with his wife and two daughters.\nAs they went down off the bridge the horses broke into a trot along the Sabana Drive.[2] On the left the Arroceros Cigar Factory resounded with the noise of the cigar-makers pounding the tobacco leaves, and Ibarra was unable to restrain a smile as he thought of the strong odor which about five o’clock in the afternoon used to float all over the Puente de Barcas and which had made him sick when he was a child. The lively conversations and the repartee of the crowds from the cigar factories carried him back to the district of Lavapiés in Madrid, with its riots of cigar-makers, so fatal for the unfortunate policemen.\nThe Botanical Garden drove away these agreeable recollections; the demon of comparison brought before his mind the Botanical Gardens of Europe, in countries where great, labor and much money are needed to make a single leaf grow or one flower open its calyx; he recalled those of the colonies, where they are well supplied and tended, and all open to the public. Ibarra turned away his gaze toward the old Manila surrounded still by its walls and moats like a sickly girl wrapped in the garments of her grandmother’s better days.\nThen the sight of the sea losing itself in the distance! “On the other shore lies Europe,” thought the young man,—“Europe, with its attractive peoples in constant movement in the search for happiness, weaving their dreams in the morning and disillusioning themselves at the setting of the sun, happy even in the midst of their calamities. Yes, on the farther shore of the boundless sea are the really spiritual nations, those who, even though they put no restraints on material development, are still more spiritual than those who pride themselves on adoring only the spirit!”\nBut these musings were in turn banished from his mind as he came in sight of the little mound in Bagumbayan Field.[3] This isolated knoll at the side of the Luneta now caught his attention and made him reminiscent. He thought of the man who had awakened his intellect and made him understand goodness and justice. The ideas which that man had impressed upon him were not many, to be sure, but they were not meaningless repetitions, they were convictions which had not paled in the light of the most brilliant foci of progress. That man was an old priest whose words of farewell still resounded in his ears: “Do not forget that if knowledge is the heritage of mankind, it is only the courageous who inherit it,” he had reminded him. “I have tried to pass on to you what I got from my teachers, the sum of which I have endeavored to increase and transmit to the coming generation as far as in me lay. You will now do the same for those who come after you, and you can treble it, since you are going to rich countries.” Then he had added with a smile, “They come here seeking wealth, go you to their country to seek also that other wealth which we lack! But remember that all that glitters is not gold.” The old man had died on that spot.\nAt these recollections the youth murmured audibly: “No, in spite of everything, the fatherland first, first the Philippines, the child of Spain, first the Spanish fatherland! No, that which is decreed by fate does not tarnish the honor of the fatherland, no!”\nHe gave little heed to Ermita, the phenix of nipa that had rearisen from its ashes under the form of blue and white houses with red-painted roofs of corrugated iron. Nor was his attention caught by Malate, neither by the cavalry barracks with the spreading trees in front, nor by the inhabitants or their little nipa huts, pyramidal or prismatic in shape, hidden away among the banana plants and areca palms, constructed like nests by each father of a family.\nThe carriage continued on its way, meeting now and then carromatas drawn by one or two ponies whose abaka harness indicated that they were from the country. The drivers would try to catch a glimpse of the occupant of the fine carriage, but would pass on without exchanging a word, without a single salute. At times a heavy cart drawn by a slow and indifferent carabao would appear on the dusty road over which beat the brilliant sunlight of the tropics. The mournful and monotonous song of the driver mounted on the back of the carabao would be mingled at one time with the screechings of a dry wheel on the huge axle of the heavy vehicle or at another time with the dull scraping of worn-out runners on a sledge which was dragged heavily through the dust, and over the ruts in the road. In the fields and wide meadows the herds were grazing, attended ever by the white buffalo-birds which roosted peacefully on the backs of the animals while these chewed their cuds or browsed in lazy contentment upon the rich grass. In the distance ponies frisked, jumping and running about, pursued by the lively colts with long tails and abundant manes who whinnied and pawed the ground with their hard hoofs.\nLet us leave the youth dreaming or dozing, since neither the sad nor the animated poetry of the open country held his attention. For him there was no charm in the sun that gleamed upon the tops of the trees and caused the rustics, with feet burned by the hot ground in spite of their callousness, to hurry along, or that made the villager pause beneath the shade of an almond tree or a bamboo brake while he pondered upon vague and inexplicable things. While the youth’s carriage sways along like a drunken thing on account of the inequalities in the surface of the road when passing over a bamboo bridge or going up an incline or descending a steep slope, let us return to Manila.\n [1] Now Plaza Cervantes.—TR.\n[2] Now Plaza Lawton and Bagumbayan; see note, infra.— TR.\n[3] The Field of Bagumbayan, adjoining the Luneta, was the place where political prisoners were shot or garroted, and was the scene of the author’s execution on December 30, 1906. It is situated just outside and east of the old Walled City (Manila proper), being the location to which the natives who had occupied the site of Manila moved their town after having been driven back by the Spaniards—hence the name, which is a Tagalog compound meaning “new town.” This place is now called Wallace Field, the name Bagumbayan being applied to the driveway which was known to the Spaniards as the Paseo de las Aguadas, or de Vidal, extending from the Luneta to the Bridge of Spain, just outside the moat that, formerly encircled the Walled City.—TR.\n Chapter IX – Local Affairs Ibarra had not been mistaken about the occupant of the victoria, for it was indeed Padre Damaso, and he was on his way to the house which the youth had just left.\n“Where are you going?” asked the friar of Maria Clara and Aunt Isabel, who were about to enter a silver-mounted carriage. In the midst of his preoccupation Padre Damaso stroked the maiden’s cheek lightly.\n“To the convent to get my things,” answered the latter.\n“Ahaa! Aha! We’ll see who’s stronger, we’ll see,” muttered the friar abstractedly, as with bowed head and slow step he turned to the stairway, leaving the two women not a little amazed.\n“He must have a sermon to preach and is memorizing it,” commented Aunt Isabel. “Get in, Maria, or we’ll be late.”\nWhether or not Padre Damaso was preparing a sermon we cannot say, but it is certain that some grave matter filled his mind, for he did not extend his hand to Capitan Tiago, who had almost to get down on his knees to kiss it.\n“Santiago,” said the friar at once, “I have an important matter to talk to you about. Let’s go into your office.”\nCapitan Tiago began to feel uneasy, so much so that he did not know what to say; but he obeyed, following the heavy figure of the priest, who closed the door behind him.\nWhile they confer in secret, let us learn what Fray Sibyla has been doing. The astute Dominican is not at the rectory, for very soon after celebrating mass he had gone to the convent of his order, situated just inside the gate of Isabel II, or of Magellan, according to what family happened to be reigning in Madrid. Without paying any attention to the rich odor of chocolate, or to the rattle of boxes and coins which came from the treasury, and scarcely acknowledging the respectful and deferential salute of the procurator-brother, he entered, passed along several corridors, and knocked at a door.\n“Come in,” sighed a weak voice.\n“May God restore health to your Reverence,” was the young Dominican’s greeting as he entered.\nSeated in a large armchair was an aged priest, wasted and rather sallow, like the saints that Rivera painted. His eyes were sunken in their hollow sockets, over which his heavy eyebrows were almost always contracted, thus accentuating their brilliant gleam. Padre Sibyla, with his arms crossed under the venerable scapulary of St. Dominic, gazed at him feelingly, then bowed his head and waited in silence.\n“Ah,” sighed the old man, “they advise an operation, an operation, Hernando, at my age! This country, O this terrible country! Take warning from my ease, Hernando!”\nFray Sibyla raised his eyes slowly and fixed them on the sick man’s face. “What has your Reverence decided to do?” he asked.\n“To die! Ah, what else can I do? I am suffering too much, but—I have made many suffer, I am paying my debt! And how are you? What has brought you here?”\n“I’ve come to talk about the business which you committed to my care.”\n“Ah! What about it?”\n“Pish!” answered the young man disgustedly, as he seated himself and turned away his face with a contemptuous expression, “They’ve been telling us fairy tales. Young Ibarra is a youth of discernment; he doesn’t seem to be a fool, but I believe that he is a good lad.”\n“You believe so?”\n“Hostilities began last night.”\n“Already? How?”\nFray Sibyla then recounted briefly what had taken place between Padre Damaso and Ibarra. “Besides,” he said in conclusion, “the young man is going to marry Capitan Tiago’s daughter, who was educated in the college of our Sisterhood. He’s rich, and won’t care to make enemies and to run the risk of ruining his fortune and his happiness.”\nThe sick man nodded in agreement. “Yes, I think as you do. With a wife like that and such a father-in-law, we’ll own him body and soul. If not, so much the better for him to declare himself an enemy of ours.”\nFray Sibyla looked at the old man in surprise.\n“For the good of our holy Order, I mean, of course,” he added, breathing heavily. “I prefer open attacks to the silly praises and flatteries of friends, which are really paid for.”\n“Does your Reverence think—”\nThe old man regarded him sadly. “Keep it clearly before you,” he answered, gasping for breath. “Our power will last as long as it is believed in. If they attack us, the government will say, ‘They attack them because they see in them an obstacle to their liberty, so then let us preserve them.’”\n“But if it should listen to them? Sometimes the government—”\n“It will not listen!”\n“Nevertheless, if, led on by cupidity, it should come to wish for itself what we are taking in—if there should be some bold and daring one—”\n“Then woe unto that one!”\nBoth remained silent for a time, then the sick man continued: “Besides, we need their attacks, to keep us awake; that makes us see our weaknesses so that we may remedy them. Exaggerated flattery will deceive us and put us to sleep, while outside our walls we shall be laughed at, and the day in which we become an object of ridicule, we shall fall as we fell in Europe. Money will not flow into our churches, no one will buy our scapularies or girdles or anything else, and when we cease to be rich we shall no longer be able to control consciences.”\n“But we shall always have our estates, our property.”\n“All will be lost as we lost them in Europe! And the worst of it is that we are working toward our own ruin. For example, this unrestrained eagerness to raise arbitrarily the rents on our lands each year, this eagerness which I have so vainly combated in all the chapters, this will ruin us! The native sees himself obliged to purchase farms in other places, which bring him as good returns as ours, or better. I fear that we are already on the decline; quos vult perdere Jupiter dementat prius.[1] For this reason we should not increase our burden; the people are already murmuring. You have decided well: let us leave the others to settle their accounts in that quarter; let us preserve the prestige that remains to us, and as we shall soon appear before God, let us wash our hands of it—and may the God of mercy have pity on our weakness!”\n“So your Reverence thinks that the rent or tax—”\n“Let’s not talk any more about money,” interrupted the sick man with signs of disgust. “You say that the lieutenant threatened to Padre Damaso that—”\n“Yes, Padre,” broke in Fray Sibyla with a faint smile, “but this morning I saw him and he told me that he was sorry for what occurred last night, that the sherry had gone to his head, and that he believed that Padre Damaso was in the same condition. ‘And your threat?’ I asked him jokingly. ‘Padre,’ he answered me, ‘I know how to keep my word when my honor is affected, but I am not nor have ever been an informer—for that reason I wear only two stars.’”\nAfter they had conversed a while longer on unimportant subjects, Fray Sibyla took his departure.\nIt was true that the lieutenant had not gone to the Palace, but the Captain-General heard what had occurred. While talking with some of his aides about the allusions that the Manila newspapers were making to him under the names of comets and celestial apparitions, one of them told him about the affair of Padre Damaso, with a somewhat heightened coloring although substantially correct as to matter.\n“From whom did you learn this?” asked his Excellency, smiling.\n“From Laruja, who was telling it this morning in the office.”\nThe Captain-General again smiled and said: “A woman or a friar can’t insult one. I contemplate living in peace for the time that I shall remain in this country and I don’t want any more quarrels with men who wear skirts. Besides, I’ve learned that the Provincial has scoffed at my orders. I asked for the removal of this friar as a punishment and they transferred him to a better town ‘monkish tricks,’ as we say in Spain.”\nBut when his Excellency found himself alone he stopped smiling. “Ah, if this people were not so stupid, I would put a curb on their Reverences,” he sighed to himself. “But every people deserves its fate, so let’s do as everybody else does.”\nCapitan Tiago, meanwhile, had concluded his interview with Padre Damaso, or rather, to speak more exactly, Padre Damaso had concluded with him.\n“So now you are warned!” said the Franciscan on leaving. “All this could have been avoided if you had consulted me beforehand, if you had not lied when I asked you. Try not to play any more foolish tricks, and trust your protector.”\nCapitan Tiago walked up and down the sala a few times, meditating and sighing. Suddenly, as if a happy thought had occurred to him, he ran to the oratory and extinguished the candles and the lamp that had been lighted for Ibarra’s safety. “The way is long and there’s yet time,” he muttered.\n [1] Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.—TR.\n Chapter X – The Town Almost on the margin of the lake, in the midst of meadows and paddy-fields, lies the town of San Diego.[1] From it sugar, rice, coffee, and fruits are either exported or sold for a small part of their value to the Chinese, who exploit the simplicity and vices of the native farmers.\nWhen on a clear day the boys ascend to the upper part of the church tower, which is beautified by moss and creeping plants, they break out into joyful exclamations at the beauty of the scene spread out before them. In the midst of the clustering roofs of nipa, tiles, corrugated iron, and palm leaves, separated by groves and gardens, each one is able to discover his own home, his little nest. Everything serves as a mark: a tree, that tamarind with its light foliage, that coco palm laden with nuts, like the Astarte Genetrix, or the Diana of Ephesus with her numerous breasts, a bending bamboo, an areca palm, or a cross. Yonder is the river, a huge glassy serpent sleeping on a green carpet, with rocks, scattered here and there along its sandy channel, that break its current into ripples. There, the bed is narrowed between high banks to which the gnarled trees cling with bared roots; here, it becomes a gentle slope where the stream widens and eddies about. Farther away, a small hut built on the edge of the high bank seems to defy the winds, the heights and the depths, presenting with its slender posts the appearance of a huge, long-legged bird watching for a reptile to seize upon. Trunks of palm or other trees with their bark still on them unite the banks by a shaky and infirm foot-bridge which, if not a very secure crossing, is nevertheless a wonderful contrivance for gymnastic exercises in preserving one’s balance, a thing not to be despised. The boys bathing in the river are amused by the difficulties of the old woman crossing with a basket on her head or by the antics of the old man who moves tremblingly and loses his staff in the water.\nBut that which always attracts particular notice is what might be called a peninsula of forest in the sea of cultivated fields. There in that wood are century-old trees with hollow trunks, which die only when their high tops are struck and set on fire by the lightning—and it is said that the fire always checks itself and dies out in the same spot. There are huge points of rock which time and nature are clothing with velvet garments of moss. Layer after layer of dust settles in the hollows, the rains beat it down, and the birds bring seeds. The tropical vegetation spreads out luxuriantly in thickets and underbrush, while curtains of interwoven vines hang from the branches of the trees and twine about their roots or spread along the ground, as if Flora were not yet satisfied but must place plant above plant. Mosses and fungi live upon the cracked trunks, and orchids—graceful guests—twine in loving embrace with the foliage of the hospitable trees.\nStrange legends exist concerning this wood, which is held in awe by the country folk. The most credible account, and therefore the one least known and believed, seems to be this. When the town was still a collection of miserable huts with the grass growing abundantly in the so-called streets, at the time when the wild boar and deer roamed about during the nights, there arrived in the place one day an old, hollow-eyed Spaniard, who spoke Tagalog rather well. After looking about and inspecting the land, he finally inquired for the owners of this wood, in which there were hot springs. Some persons who claimed to be such presented themselves, and the old man acquired it in exchange for clothes, jewels, and a sum of money. Soon afterward he disappeared mysteriously. The people thought that he had been spirited away, when a bad odor from the neighboring wood attracted the attention of some herdsmen. Tracing this, they found the decaying corpse of the old Spaniard hanging from the branch of a balete tree.[2] In life he had inspired fear by his deep, hollow voice, his sunken eyes, and his mirthless laugh, but now, dead by his own act, he disturbed the sleep of the women. Some threw the jewels into the river and burned the clothes, and from the time that the corpse was buried at the foot of the balete itself, no one willingly ventured near the spot. A belated herdsman looking for some of his strayed charges told of lights that he had seen there, and when some venturesome youths went to the place they heard mournful cries. To win the smiles of his disdainful lady, a forlorn lover agreed to spend the night there and in proof to wrap around the trunk a long piece of rattan, but he died of a quick fever that seized him the very next day. Stories and legends still cluster about the place.\nA few months after the finding of the old Spaniard’s body there appeared a youth, apparently a Spanish mestizo, who said that he was the son of the deceased. He established himself in the place and devoted his attention to agriculture, especially the raising of indigo. Don Saturnino was a silent young man with a violent disposition, even cruel at times, yet he was energetic and industrious. He surrounded the grave of his father with a wall, but visited it only at rare intervals. When he was along in years, he married a young woman from Manila, and she became the mother of Don Rafael, the father of Crisostomo. From his youth Don Rafael was a favorite with the country people. The agricultural methods introduced and encouraged by his father spread rapidly, new settlers poured in, the Chinese came, and the settlement became a village with a native priest. Later the village grew into a town, the priest died, and Fray Damaso came.\nAll this time the tomb and the land around it remained unmolested. Sometimes a crowd of boys armed with clubs and stones would become bold enough to wander into the place to gather guavas, papayas, lomboy, and other fruits, but it frequently happened that when their sport was at its height, or while they gazed in awed silence at the rotting piece of rope which still swung from the branch, stones would fall, coming from they knew not where. Then with cries of “The old man! The old man!” they would throw away fruit and clubs, jump from the trees, and hurry between the rocks and through the thickets; nor would they stop running until they were well out of the wood, some pale and breathless, others weeping, and only a few laughing.\n [1] We have been unable to find any town of this name, but many of these conditions.—Author’s note.\nSan Diego and Santiago are variant forms of the name of the patron saint of Spain, St. James.—TR.\n[2] The “sacred tree” of Malaya, being a species of banyan that begins life as a vine twining on another tree, which it finally strangles, using the dead trunk as a support until it is able to stand alone. When old it often covers a large space with gnarled and twisted trunks of varied shapes and sizes, thus presenting a weird and grotesque appearance. This tree was held in reverent awe by the primitive Filipinos, who believed it to be the abode of the nono, or ancestral ghosts, and is still the object of superstitious beliefs,—TR.\n Chapter XI – The Rulers  Divide and rule.\n (The New Machiavelli)\nWho were the caciques of the town?\nDon Rafael, when alive, even though he was the richest, owned more land, and was the patron of nearly everybody, had not been one of them. As he was modest and depreciated the value of his own deeds, no faction in his favor had ever been formed in the town, and we have already seen how the people all rose up against him when they saw him hesitate upon being attacked.\nCould it be Capitan Tiago? True it was that when he went there he was received with an orchestra by his debtors, who banqueted him and heaped gifts upon him. The finest fruits burdened his table and a quarter of deer or wild boar was his share of the hunt. If he found the horse of a debtor beautiful, half an hour afterwards it was in his stable. All this was true, but they laughed at him behind his back and in secret called him “Sacristan Tiago.”\nPerhaps it was the gobernadorcillo?[1] No, for he was only an unhappy mortal who commanded not, but obeyed; who ordered not, but was ordered; who drove not, but was driven. Nevertheless, he had to answer to the alcalde for having commanded, ordered, and driven, just as if he were the originator of everything. Yet be it said to his credit that he had never presumed upon or usurped such honors, which had cost him five thousand pesos and many humiliations. But considering the income it brought him, it was cheap.\nWell then, might it be God? Ah, the good God disturbed neither the consciences nor the sleep of the inhabitants. At least, He did not make them tremble, and if by chance He might have been mentioned in a sermon, surely they would have sighed longingly, “Oh, that only there were a God!” To the good Lord they paid little attention, as the saints gave them enough to do. For those poor folk God had come to be like those unfortunate monarchs who are surrounded by courtiers to whom alone the people render homage.\nSan Diego was a kind of Rome: not the Rome of the time when the cunning Romulus laid out its walls with a plow, nor of the later time when, bathed in its own and others’ blood, it dictated laws to the world—no, it was a Rome of our own times with the difference that in place of marble monuments and colosseums it had its monuments of sawali and its cockpit of nipa. The curate was the Pope in the Vatican; the alferez of the Civil Guard, the King of Italy on the Quirinal: all, it must be understood, on a scale of nipa and bamboo. Here, as there, continual quarreling went on, since each wished to be the master and considered the other an intruder. Let us examine the characteristics of each.\nFray Bernardo Salvi was that silent young Franciscan of whom we have spoken before. In his habits and manners he was quite different from his brethren and even from his predecessor, the violent Padre Damaso. He was thin and sickly, habitually pensive, strict in the fulfilment of his religious duties, and careful of his good name. In a month after his arrival nearly every one in the town had joined the Venerable Tertiary Order, to the great distress of its rival, the Society of the Holy Rosary. His soul leaped with joy to see about each neck four or five scapularies and around each waist a knotted girdle, and to behold the procession of corpses and ghosts in guingón habits. The senior sacristan made a small fortune selling—or giving away as alms, we should say—all things necessary for the salvation of the soul and the warfare against the devil, as it is well known that this spirit, which formerly had the temerity to contradict God himself face to face and to doubt His words, as is related in the holy book of Job, who carried our Lord Christ through the air as afterwards in the Dark Ages he carried the ghosts, and continues, according to report, to carry the asuang of the Philippines, now seems to have become so shamefaced that he cannot endure the sight of a piece of painted cloth and that he fears the knots on a cord. But all this proves nothing more than that there is progress on this side also and that the devil is backward, or at least a conservative, as are all who dwell in darkness. Otherwise, we must attribute to him the weakness of a fifteen-year-old girl.\nAs we have said, Fray Salvi was very assiduous in the fulfilment of his duties, too assiduous, the alferez thought. While he was preaching—he was very fond of preaching—the doors of the church were closed, wherein he was like Nero, who allowed no one to leave the theater while he was singing. But the former did it for the salvation and the latter for the corruption of souls. Fray Salvi rarely resorted to blows, but was accustomed to punish every shortcoming of his subordinates with fines. In this respect he was very different from Padre Damaso, who had been accustomed to settle everything with his fists or a cane, administering such chastisement with the greatest good-will. For this, however, he should not be judged too harshly, as he was firm in the belief that the Indian could be managed only by beating him, just as was affirmed by a friar who knew enough to write books, and Padre Damaso never disputed anything that he saw in print, a credulity of which many might have reason to complain. Although Fray Salvi made little use of violence, yet, as an old wiseacre of the town said, what he lacked in quantity he made up in quality. But this should not be counted against him, for the fasts and abstinences thinned his blood and unstrung his nerves and, as the people said, the wind got into his head. Thus it came about that it was not possible to learn from the condition of the sacristans’ backs whether the curate was fasting or feasting.\nThe only rival of this spiritual power, with tendencies toward the temporal, was, as we have said, the alferez: the only one, since the women told how the devil himself would flee from the curate, because, having one day dared to tempt him, he was caught, tied to a bedpost, soundly whipped with a rope, and set at liberty only after nine days. As a consequence, any one who after this would still be the enemy of such a man, deserved to fall into worse repute than even the weak and unwary devils.\nBut the alferez deserved his fate. His wife was an old Filipina of abundant rouge and paint, known as Doña Consolacion—although her husband and some others called her by quite another name. The alferez revenged his conjugal misfortunes on his own person by getting so drunk that he made a tank of himself, or by ordering his soldiers to drill in the sun while he remained in the shade, or, more frequently, by beating up his consort, who, if she was not a lamb of God to take away one’s sins, at least served to lay up for her spouse many torments in Purgatory—if perchance he should get there, a matter of doubt to the devout women. As if for the fun of it, these two used to beat each other up beautifully, giving free shows to the neighborhood with vocal and instrumental accompaniments, four-handed, soft, loud, with pedal and all.\nWhenever these scandals reached the ears of Padre Salvi, he would smile, cross himself, and recite a paternoster. They called him a grafter, a hypocrite, a Carlist, and a miser: he merely smiled and recited more prayers. The alferez had a little anecdote which he always related to the occasional Spaniards who visited him:\n“Are you going over to the convento to visit the sanctimonious rascal there, the little curate? Yes! Well, if he offers you chocolate which I doubt—but if he offers it remember this: if he calls to the servant and says, ‘Juan, make a cup of chocolate, eh!’ then stay without fear; but if he calls out, ‘Juan, make a cup of chocolate, ah!’ then take your hat and leave on a run.”\n“What!” the startled visitor would ask, “does he poison people? Carambas!”\n“No, man, not at all!”\n“What then?”\n“‘Chocolate, eh!’ means thick and rich, while ‘chocolate, ah!’ means watered and thin.”\nBut we are of the opinion that this was a slander on the part of the alferez, since the same story is told of many curates. At least, it may be a thing peculiar to the Order.\nTo make trouble for the curate, the soldier, at the instigation of his wife, would prohibit any one from walking abroad after nine o’clock at night. Doña Consolacion would then claim that she had seen the curate, disguised in a piña camisa and salakot, walking about late. Fray Salvi would take his revenge in a holy manner. Upon seeing the alferez enter the church he would innocently order the sacristan to close all the doors, and would then go up into the pulpit and preach until the very saints closed their eyes and even the wooden dove above his head, the image of the Holy Ghost, murmured for mercy. But the alferez, like all the unregenerate, did not change his ways for this; he would go away cursing, and as soon as he was able to catch a sacristan, or one of the curate’s servants, he would arrest him, give him a beating, and make him scrub the floor of the barracks and that of his own house, which at such times was put in a decent condition. On going to pay the fine imposed by the curate for his absence, the sacristan would explain the cause. Fray Salvi would listen in silence, take the money, and at once turn out his goats and sheep so that they might graze in the alferez’s garden, while he himself looked up a new text for another longer and more edifying sermon. But these were only little pleasantries, and if the two chanced to meet they would shake hands and converse politely.\nWhen her husband was sleeping off the wine he had drunk, or was snoring through the siesta, and she could not quarrel with him, Doña Consolacion, in a blue flannel camisa, with a big cigar in her mouth, would take her stand at the window. She could not endure the young people, so from there she would scrutinize and mock the passing girls, who, being afraid of her, would hurry by in confusion, holding their breath the while, and not daring to raise their eyes. One great virtue Doña Consolation possessed, and this was that she had evidently never looked in a mirror.\nThese were the rulers of the town of San Diego.\n [1] “Petty governor,” the chief municipal official, chosen annually from among their own number, with the approval of the parish priest and the central government, by the principalía, i.e., persons who owned considerable property or who had previously held some municipal office. The manner of his selection is thus described by a German traveler (Jagor) in the Philippines in 1860: “The election is held in the town hall. The governor or his representative presides, having on his right the parish priest and on his left a clerk, who also acts as interpreter. All the cabezas de barangay, the gobernadorcillo, and those who have formerly occupied the latter position, seat themselves on benches. First, there are chosen by lot six cabezas de barangay and six ex-gobernadorcillos as electors, the actual gobernadorcillo being the thirteenth. The rest leave the hall. After the presiding officer has read the statutes in a loud voice and reminded the electors of their duty to act in accordance with their consciences and to heed only the welfare of the town, the electors move to a table and write three names on a slip of paper. The person receiving a majority of votes is declared elected gobernadorcillo for the ensuing year, provided that there is no protest from the curate or the electors, and always conditioned upon the approval of the superior authority in Manila, which is never withheld, since the influence of the curate is enough to prevent an unsatisfactory election.”—TR.\n Chapter XII – All Saints The one thing perhaps that indisputably distinguishes man from the brute creation is the attention which he pays to those who have passed away and, wonder of wonders! this characteristic seems to be more deeply rooted in proportion to the lack of civilization. Historians relate that the ancient inhabitants of the Philippines venerated and deified their ancestors; but now the contrary is true, and the dead have to entrust themselves to the living. It is also related that the people of New Guinea preserve the bones of their dead in chests and maintain communication with them. The greater part of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and America offer them the finest products of their kitchens or dishes of what was their favorite food when alive, and give banquets at which they believe them to be present. The Egyptians raised up palaces and the Mussulmans built shrines, but the masters in these things, those who have most clearly read the human heart, are the people of Dahomey. These negroes know that man is revengeful, so they consider that nothing will more content the dead than to sacrifice all his enemies upon his grave, and, as man is curious and may not know how to entertain himself in the other life, each year they send him a newsletter under the skin of a beheaded slave.\nWe ourselves differ from all the rest. In spite of the inscriptions on the tombs, hardly any one believes that the dead rest, and much less, that they rest in peace. The most optimistic fancies his forefathers still roasting in purgatory and, if it turns out that he himself be not completely damned, he will yet be able to associate with them for many years. If any one would contradict let him visit the churches and cemeteries of the country on All Saints’ day and he will be convinced.\nNow that we are in San Diego let us visit its cemetery, which is located in the midst of paddy-fields, there toward the west—not a city, merely a village of the dead, approached by a path dusty in dry weather and navigable on rainy days. A wooden gate and a fence half of stone and half of bamboo stakes, appear to separate it from the abode of the living but not from the curate’s goats and some of the pigs of the neighborhood, who come and go making explorations among the tombs and enlivening the solitude with their presence. In the center of this enclosure rises a large wooden cross set on a stone pedestal. The storms have doubled over the tin plate for the inscription INRI, and the rains have effaced the letters. At the foot of the cross, as on the real Golgotha, is a confused heap of skulls and bones which the indifferent grave-digger has thrown from the graves he digs, and there they will probably await, not the resurrection of the dead, but the coming of the animals to defile them. Round about may be noted signs of recent excavations; here the earth is sunken, there it forms a low mound. There grow in all their luxuriance the tarambulo to prick the feet with its spiny berries and the pandakaki to add its odor to that of the cemetery, as if the place did not have smells enough already. Yet the ground is sprinkled with a few little flowers which, like those skulls, are known only to their Creator; their petals wear a pale smile and their fragrance is the fragrance of the tombs. The grass and creepers fill up the corners or climb over the walls and niches to cover and beautify the naked ugliness and in places even penetrate into the fissures made by the earthquakes, so as to hide from sight the revered hollowness of the sepulcher.\nAt the time we enter, the people have driven the animals away, with the single exception of some old hog, an animal that is hard to convince, who shows his small eyes and pulling back his head from a great gap in the fence, sticks up his snout and seems to say to a woman praying near, “Don’t eat it all, leave something for me, won’t you?”\nTwo men are digging a grave near one of the tottering walls. One of them, the grave-digger, works with indifference, throwing about bones as a gardener does stones and dry branches, while the other, more intent on his work, is perspiring, smoking, and spitting at every moment.\n“Listen,” says the latter in Tagalog, “wouldn’t it be better for us to dig in some other place? This is too recent.”\n“One grave is as recent as another.”\n“I can’t stand it any longer! That bone you’re just cut in two has blood oozing from it—and those hairs?”\n“But how sensitive you are!” was the other’s reproach. “Just as if you were a town clerk! If, like myself, you had dug up a corpse of twenty days, on a dark and rainy night—! My lantern went out—”\nHis companion shuddered.\n“The coffin burst open, the corpse fell half-way out, it stunk—and supposing you had to carry it—the rain wet us both—”\n“Ugh! And why did you dig it up?”\nThe grave-digger looked at him in surprise. “Why? How do I know? I was ordered to do so.”\n“Who ordered you?”\nThe grave-digger stepped backward and looked his companion over from head to foot. “Man, you’re like a Spaniard, for afterwards a Spaniard asked me the same questions, but in secret. So I’m going to answer you as I answered the Spaniard: the fat curate ordered me to do so.”\n“Ah! And what did you do with the corpse afterwards?” further questioned the sensitive one.\n“The devil! If I didn’t know you and was not sure that you are a man I would say that you were certainly a Spaniard of the Civil Guard, since you ask questions just as he did. Well, the fat curate ordered me to bury it in the Chinamen’s cemetery, but the coffin was heavy and the Chinese cemetery far away—”\n“No, no! I’m not going to dig any more!” the other interrupted in horror as he threw away his spade and jumped out of the hole. “I’ve cut a skull in two and I’m afraid that it won’t let me sleep tonight.” The old grave-digger laughed to see how the chicken-hearted fellow left, crossing himself.\nThe cemetery was filling up with men and women dressed in mourning. Some sought a grave for a time, disputing among themselves the while, and as if they were unable to agree, they scattered about, each kneeling where he thought best. Others, who had niches for their deceased relatives, lighted candles and fell to praying devoutly. Exaggerated or suppressed sighs and sobs were heard amid the hum of prayers, orapreo, orapreiss, requiem-aeternams, that arose from all sides.\nA little old man with bright eyes entered bareheaded. Upon seeing him many laughed, and some women knitted their eyebrows. The old man did not seem to pay any attention to these demonstrations as he went toward a pile of skulls and knelt to look earnestly for something among the bones. Then he carefully removed the skulls one by one, but apparently without finding what he sought, for he wrinkled his brow, nodded his head from side to side, looked all about him, and finally rose and approached the grave-digger, who raised his head when the old man spoke to him.\n“Do you know where there is a beautiful skull, white as the meat of a coconut, with a complete set of teeth, which I had there at the foot of the cross under those leaves?”\nThe grave-digger shrugged his shoulders.\n“Look!” added the old man, showing a silver coin, “I have only this, but I’ll give it to you if you find the skull for me.”\nThe gleam of the silver caused the grave-digger to consider, and staring toward the heap of bones he said, “Isn’t it there? No? Then I don’t know where it is.”\n“Don’t you know? When those who owe me pay me, I’ll give you more,” continued the old man. “It was the skull of my wife, so if you find it for me—”\n“Isn’t it there? Then I don’t know! But if you wish, I can give you another.”\n“You’re like the grave you’re digging,” apostrophized the old man nervously. “You don’t know the value of what you lose. For whom is that grave?”\n“How should I know?” replied the other in bad humor.\n“For a corpse!”\n“Like the grave, like the grave!” repeated the old man with a dry smile. “You don’t know what you throw away nor what you receive! Dig, dig on!” And he turned away in the direction of the gate.\nMeanwhile, the grave-digger had completed his task, attested by the two mounds of fresh red earth at the sides of the grave. He took some buyo from his salakot and began to chew it while he stared stupidly at what was going on around him.\n Chapter XIII – Signs of Storm As the old man was leaving the cemetery there stopped at the head of the path a carriage which, from its dust-covered appearance and sweating horses, seemed to have come from a great distance. Followed by an aged servant, Ibarra left the carriage and dismissed it with a wave of his hand, then gravely and silently turned toward the cemetery.\n“My illness and my duties have not permitted me to return,” said the old servant timidly. “Capitan Tiago promised that he would see that a niche was constructed, but I planted some flowers on the grave and set up a cross carved by my own hands.” Ibarra made no reply. “There behind that big cross, sir,” he added when they were well inside the gate, as he pointed to the place.\nIbarra was so intent upon his quest that he did not notice the movement of surprise on the part of the persons who recognized him and suspended their prayers to watch him curiously. He walked along carefully to avoid stepping on any of the graves, which were easily distinguishable by the hollow places in the soil. In other times he had walked on them carelessly, but now they were to be respected: his father lay among them. When he reached the large cross he stopped and looked all around. His companion stood confused and confounded, seeking some mark in the ground, but nowhere was any cross to be seen.\n“Was it here?” he murmured through his teeth. “No, there! But the ground has been disturbed.”\nIbarra gave him a look of anguish.\n“Yes,” he went on, “I remember that there was a stone near it. The grave was rather short. The grave-digger was sick, so a farmer had to dig it. But let’s ask that man what has become of the cross.”\nThey went over to where the grave-digger was watching them with curiosity. He removed his salakot respectfully as they approached.\n“Can you tell me which is the grave there that had a cross over it?” asked the servant.\nThe grave-digger looked toward the place and reflected. “A big cross?”\n“Yes, a big one!” affirmed the servant eagerly, with a significant look at Ibarra, whose face lighted up.\n“A carved cross tied up with rattan?” continued the grave-digger.\n“That’s it, that’s it, like this!” exclaimed the servant in answer as he drew on the ground the figure of a Byzantine cross.\n“Were there flowers scattered on the grave?”\n“Oleanders and tuberoses and forget-me-nots, yes!” the servant added joyfully, offering the grave-digger a cigar.\n“Tell us which is the grave and where the cross is.”\nThe grave-digger scratched his ear and answered with a yawn: “Well, as for the cross, I burned it.”\n“Burned it? Why did you burn it?”\n“Because the fat curate ordered me to do so.”\n“Who is the fat curate?” asked Ibarra.\n“Who? Why, the one that beats people with a big cane.”\nIbarra drew his hand across his forehead. “But at least you can tell us where the grave is. You must remember that.”\nThe grave-digger smiled as he answered quietly, “But the corpse is no longer there.”\n“What’s that you’re saying?”\n“Yes,” continued the grave-digger in a half-jesting tone. “I buried a woman in that place a week ago.”\n“Are you crazy?” cried the servant. “It hasn’t been a year since we buried him.”\n“That’s very true, but a good many months ago I dug the body up. The fat curate ordered me to do so and to take it to the cemetery of the Chinamen. But as it was heavy and there was rain that night—”\nHe was stopped by the threatening attitude of Ibarra, who had caught him by the arm and was shaking him. “Did you do that?” demanded the youth in an indescribable tone.\n“Don’t be angry, sir,” stammered the pale and trembling grave-digger. “I didn’t bury him among the Chinamen. Better be drowned than lie among Chinamen, I said to myself, so I threw the body into the lake.”\nIbarra placed both his hands on the grave-digger’s shoulders and stared at him for a long time with an indefinable expression. Then, with the ejaculation, “You are only a miserable slave!” he turned away hurriedly, stepping upon bones, graves, and crosses, like one beside himself.\nThe grave-digger patted his arm and muttered, “All the trouble dead men cause! The fat padre caned me for allowing it to be buried while I was sick, and this fellow almost tore my arm off for having dug it up. That’s what these Spaniards are! I’ll lose my job yet!”\nIbarra walked rapidly with a far-away look in his eyes, while the aged servant followed him weeping. The sun was setting, and over the eastern sky was flung a heavy curtain of clouds. A dry wind shook the tree-tops and made the bamboo clumps creak. Ibarra went bareheaded, but no tear wet his eyes nor did any sigh escape from his breast. He moved as if fleeing from something, perhaps the shade of his father, perhaps the approaching storm. He crossed through the town to the outskirts on the opposite side and turned toward the old house which he had not entered for so many years. Surrounded by a cactus-covered wall it seemed to beckon to him with its open windows, while the ilang-ilang waved its flower-laden branches joyfully and the doves circled about the conical roof of their cote in the middle of the garden.\nBut the youth gave no heed to these signs of welcome back to his old home, his eyes being fixed on the figure of a priest approaching from the opposite direction. It was the curate of San Diego, the pensive Franciscan whom we have seen before, the rival of the alferez. The breeze folded back the brim of his wide hat and blew his guingón habit closely about him, revealing the outlines of his body and his thin, curved thighs. In his right hand he carried an ivory-headed palasan cane.\nThis was the first time that he and Ibarra had met. When they drew near each other Ibarra stopped and gazed at him from head to foot; Fray Salvi avoided the look and tried to appear unconcerned. After a moment of hesitation Ibarra went up to him quickly and dropping a heavy hand on his shoulder, asked in a husky voice, “What did you do with my father?”\nFray Salvi, pale and trembling as he read the deep feelings that flushed the youth’s face, could not answer; he seemed paralyzed.\n“What did you do with my father?” again demanded the youth in a choking voice.\nThe priest, who was gradually being forced to his knees by the heavy hand that pressed upon his shoulder, made a great effort and answered, “You are mistaken, I did nothing to your father.”\n“You didn’t?” went on the youth, forcing him down upon his knees.\n“No, I assure you! It was my predecessor, it was Padre Damaso!”\n“Ah!” exclaimed the youth, releasing his hold, and clapping his hand desperately to his brow; then, leaving poor Fray Salvi, he turned away and hurried toward his house. The old servant came up and helped the friar to his feet.\n Chapter XIV – Tasio: Lunatic or Sage The peculiar old man wandered about the streets aimlessly. A former student of philosophy, he had given up his career in obedience to his mother’s wishes and not from any lack of means or ability. Quite the contrary, it was because his mother was rich and he was said to possess talent. The good woman feared that her son would become learned and forget God, so she had given him his choice of entering the priesthood or leaving college. Being in love, he chose the latter course and married. Then having lost both his wife and his mother within a year, he sought consolation in his books in order to free himself from sorrow, the cockpit, and the dangers of idleness. He became so addicted to his studies and the purchase of books, that he entirely neglected his fortune and gradually ruined himself. Persons of culture called him Don Anastasio, or Tasio the Sage, while the great crowd of the ignorant knew him as Tasio the Lunatic, on account of his peculiar ideas and his eccentric manner of dealing with others.\nAs we said before, the evening threatened to be stormy. The lightning flashed its pale rays across the leaden sky, the air was heavy and the slight breeze excessively sultry. Tasio had apparently already forgotten his beloved skull, and now he was smiling as he looked at the dark clouds. Near the church he met a man wearing an alpaca coat, who carried in one hand a large bundle of candles and in the other a tasseled cane, the emblem of his office as gobernadorcillo.\n“You seem to be merry?” he greeted Tasio in Tagalog.\n“Truly I am, señor capitan, I’m merry because I hope for something.”\n“Ah? What do you hope for?”\n“The storm!”\n“The storm? Are you thinking of taking a bath?” asked the gobernadorcillo in a jesting way as he stared at the simple attire of the old man.\n“A bath? That’s not a bad idea, especially when one has just stumbled over some trash!” answered Tasio in a similar, though somewhat more offensive tone, staring at the other’s face. “But I hope for something better.”\n“What, then?”\n“Some thunderbolts that will kill people and burn down houses,” returned the Sage seriously.\n“Why don’t you ask for the deluge at once?”\n“We all deserve it, even you and I! You, señor gobernadorcillo, have there a bundle of tapers that came from some Chinese shop, yet this now makes the tenth year that I have been proposing to each new occupant of your office the purchase of lightning-rods. Every one laughs at me, and buys bombs and rockets and pays for the ringing of bells. Even you yourself, on the day after I made my proposition, ordered from the Chinese founders a bell in honor of St. Barbara,[1] when science has shown that it is dangerous to ring the bells during a storm. Explain to me why in the year ’70, when lightning struck in Biñan, it hit the very church tower and destroyed the clock and altar. What was the bell of St. Barbara doing then?”\nAt the moment there was a vivid flash. “Jesús, María, y José! Holy St. Barbara!” exclaimed the gobernadorcillo, turning pale and crossing himself.\nTasio burst out into a loud laugh. “You are worthy of your patroness,” he remarked dryly in Spanish as he turned his back and went toward the church.\nInside, the sacristans were preparing a catafalque, bordered with candles placed in wooden sockets. Two large tables had been placed one above the other and covered with black cloth across which ran white stripes, with here and there a skull painted on it.\n“Is that for the souls or for the candles?” inquired the old man, but noticing two boys, one about ten and the other seven, he turned to them without awaiting an answer from the sacristans.\n“Won’t you come with me, boys?” he asked them. “Your mother has prepared a supper for you fit for a curate.”\n“The senior sacristan will not let us leave until eight o’clock, sir,” answered the larger of the two boys. “I expect to get my pay to give it to our mother.”\n“Ah! And where are you going now?”\n“To the belfry, sir, to ring the knell for the souls.”\n“Going to the belfry! Then take care! Don’t go near the bells during the storm!”\nTasio then left the church, not without first bestowing a look of pity on the two boys, who were climbing the stairway into the organ-loft. He passed his hand over his eyes, looked at the sky again, and murmured, “Now I should be sorry if thunderbolts should fall.” With his head bowed in thought he started toward the outskirts of the town.\n“Won’t you come in?” invited a voice in Spanish from a window.\nThe Sage raised his head and saw a man of thirty or thirty-five years of age smiling at him.\n“What are you reading there?” asked Tasio, pointing to a book the man held in his hand.\n“A work just published: ‘The Torments Suffered by the Blessed Souls in Purgatory,’” the other answered with a smile.\n“Man, man, man!” exclaimed the Sage in an altered tone as he entered the house. “The author must be a very clever person.”\nUpon reaching the top of the stairway, he was cordially received by the master of the house, Don Filipo Lino, and his young wife, Doña Teodora Viña. Don Filipo was the teniente-mayor of the town and leader of one of the parties—the liberal faction, if it be possible to speak so, and if there exist parties in the towns of the Philippines.\n“Did you meet in the cemetery the son of the deceased Don Rafael, who has just returned from Europe?”\n“Yes, I saw him as he alighted from his carriage.”\n“They say that he went to look for his father’s grave. It must have been a terrible blow.”\nThe Sage shrugged his shoulders.\n“Doesn’t such a misfortune affect you?” asked the young wife.\n“You know very well that I was one of the six who accompanied the body, and it was I who appealed to the Captain-General when I saw that no one, not even the authorities, said anything about such an outrage, although I always prefer to honor a good man in life rather than to worship him after his death.”\n“Well?”\n“But, madam, I am not a believer in hereditary monarchy. By reason of the Chinese blood which I have received from my mother I believe a little like the Chinese: I honor the father on account of the son and not the son on account of the father. I believe that each one should receive the reward or punishment for his own deeds, not for those of another.”\n“Did you order a mass said for your dead wife, as I advised you yesterday?” asked the young woman, changing the subject of conversation.\n“No,” answered the old man with a smile.\n“What a pity!” she exclaimed with unfeigned regret.\n“They say that until ten o’clock tomorrow the souls will wander at liberty, awaiting the prayers of the living, and that during these days one mass is equivalent to five on other days of the year, or even to six, as the curate said this morning.”\n“What! Does that mean that we have a period without paying, which we should take advantage of?”\n“But, Doray,” interrupted Don Filipo, “you know that Don Anastasio doesn’t believe in purgatory.”\n“I don’t believe in purgatory!” protested the old man, partly rising from his seat. “Even when I know something of its history!”\n“The history of purgatory!” exclaimed the couple, full of surprise. “Come, relate it to us.”\n“You don’t know it and yet you order masses and talk about its torments? Well, as it has begun to rain and threatens to continue, we shall have time to relieve the monotony,” replied Tasio, falling into a thoughtful mood.\nDon Filipo closed the book which he held in his hand and Doray sat down at his side determined not to believe anything that the old man was about to say.\nThe latter began in the following manner: “Purgatory existed long before Our Lord came into the world and must have been located in the center of the earth, according to Padre Astete; or somewhere near Cluny, according to the monk of whom Padre Girard tells us. But the location is of least importance here. Now then, who were scorching in those fires that had been burning from the beginning of the world? Its very ancient existence is proved by Christian philosophy, which teaches that God has created nothing new since he rested.”\n“But it could have existed in potentia and not in actu,”[2] observed Don Filipo.\n“Very well! But yet I must answer that some knew of it and as existing in actu. One of these was Zarathustra, or Zoroaster, who wrote part of the Zend-Avesta and founded a religion which in some points resembles ours, and Zarathustra, according to the scholars, flourished at least eight hundred years before Christ. I say ‘at least,’ since Gaffarel, after examining the testimony of Plato, Xanthus of Lydia, Pliny, Hermippus, and Eudoxus, believes it to have been two thousand five hundred years before our era. However that may be, it is certain that Zarathustra talked of a kind of purgatory and showed ways of getting free from it. The living could redeem the souls of those who died in sin by reciting passages from the Avesta and by doing good works, but under the condition that the person offering the petitions should be a relative, up to the fourth generation. The time for this occurred every year and lasted five days. Later, when this belief had become fixed among the people, the priests of that religion saw in it a chance of profit and so they exploited ‘the deep and dark prison where remorse reigns,’ as Zarathustra called it. They declared that by the payment of a small coin it was possible to save a soul from a year of torture, but as in that religion there were sins punishable by three hundred to a thousand years of suffering, such as lying, faithlessness, failure to keep one’s word, and so on, it resulted that the rascals took in countless sums. Here you will observe something like our purgatory, if you take into account the differences in the religions.”\nA vivid flash of lightning, followed by rolling thunder, caused Doray to start up and exclaim, as she crossed herself: “Jesús, María, y José! I’m going to leave you, I’m going to burn some sacred palm and light candles of penitence.”\nThe rain began to fall in torrents. The Sage Tasio, watching the young woman leave, continued: “Now that she is not here, we can consider this matter more rationally. Doray, even though a little superstitious, is a good Catholic, and I don’t care to root out the faith from her heart. A pure and simple faith is as distinct from fanaticism as the flame from smoke or music from discords: only the fools and the deaf confuse them. Between ourselves we can say that the idea of purgatory is good, holy, and rational. It perpetuates the union of those who were and those who are, leading thus to greater purity of life. The evil is in its abuse.\n“But let us now see where Catholicism got this idea, which does not exist in the Old Testament nor in the Gospels. Neither Moses nor Christ made the slightest mention of it, and the single passage which is cited from Maccabees is insufficient. Besides, this book was declared apocryphal by the Council of Laodicea and the holy Catholic Church accepted it only later. Neither have the pagan religions anything like it. The oft-quoted passage in Virgil, Aliae panduntur inanes,[3] which probably gave occasion for St. Gregory the Great to speak of drowned souls, and to Dante for another narrative in his Divine Comedy, cannot have been the origin of this belief. Neither the Brahmins, the Buddhists, nor the Egyptians, who may have given Rome her Charon and her Avernus, had anything like this idea. I won’t speak now of the religions of northern Europe, for they were religions of warriors, bards, and hunters, and not of philosophers. While they yet preserve their beliefs and even their rites under Christian forms, they were unable to accompany the hordes in the spoliation of Rome or to seat themselves on the Capitoline; the religions of the mists were dissipated by the southern sun. Now then, the early Christians did not believe in a purgatory but died in the blissful confidence of shortly seeing God face to face. Apparently the first fathers of the Church who mentioned it were St. Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and St. Irenaeus, who were all perhaps influenced by Zarathustra’s religion, which still flourished and was widely spread throughout the East, since at every step we read reproaches against Origen’s Orientalism. St. Irenaeus proved its existence by the fact that Christ remained ‘three days in the depths of the earth,’ three days of purgatory, and deduced from this that every soul must remain there until the resurrection of the body, although the ‘Hodie mecum eris in Paradiso’[4] seems to contradict it. St. Augustine also speaks of purgatory and, if not affirming its existence, yet he did not believe it impossible, conjecturing that in another existence there might continue the punishments that we receive in this life for our sins.”\n“The devil with St. Augustine!” ejaculated Don Filipo. “He wasn’t satisfied with what we suffer here but wished a continuance.”\n“Well, so it went” some believed it and others didn’t. Although St. Gregory finally came to admit it in his de quibusdam levibus culpis esse ante judicium purgatorius ignis credendus est,[5] yet nothing definite was done until the year 1439, that is, eight centuries later, when the Council of Florence declared that there must exist a purifying fire for the souls of those who have died in the love of God but without having satisfied divine Justice. Lastly, the Council of Trent under Pius IV in 1563, in the twenty-fifth session, issued the purgatorial decree beginning Cura catholica ecclesia, Spiritu Santo edocta, wherein it deduces that, after the office of the mass, the petitions of the living, their prayers, alms, and other pious works are the surest means of freeing the souls. Nevertheless, the Protestants do not believe in it nor do the Greek Fathers, since they reject any Biblical authority for it and say that our responsibility ends with death, and that the ‘Quodcumque ligaberis in terra,’[6] does not mean ‘usque ad purgatorium,’[7] but to this the answer can be made that since purgatory is located in the center of the earth it fell naturally under the control of St. Peter. But I should never get through if I had to relate all that has been said on the subject. Any day that you wish to discuss the matter with me, come to my house and there we will consult the books and talk freely and quietly.\n“Now I must go. I don’t understand why Christian piety permits robbery on this night—and you, the authorities, allow it—and I fear for my books. If they should steal them to read I wouldn’t object, but I know that there are many who wish to burn them in order to do for me an act of charity, and such charity, worthy of the Caliph Omar, is to be dreaded. Some believe that on account of those books I am already damned—”\n“But I suppose that you do believe in damnation?” asked Doray with a smile, as she appeared carrying in a brazier the dry palm leaves, which gave off a peculiar smoke and an agreeable odor.\n“I don’t know, madam, what God will do with me,” replied the old man thoughtfully. “When I die I will commit myself to Him without fear and He may do with me what He wishes. But a thought strikes me!”\n“What thought is that?”\n“If the only ones who can be saved are the Catholics, and of them only five per cent—as many curates say—and as the Catholics form only a twelfth part of the population of the world—if we believe what statistics show—it would result that after damning millions and millions of men during the countless ages that passed before the Saviour came to the earth, after a Son of God has died for us, it is now possible to save only five in every twelve hundred. That cannot be so! I prefer to believe and say with Job: ‘Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro, and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?’ No, such a calamity is impossible and to believe it is blasphemy!”\n“What do you wish? Divine Justice, divine Purity—”\n“Oh, but divine Justice and divine Purity saw the future before the creation,” answered the old man, as he rose shuddering. “Man is an accidental and not a necessary part of creation, and that God cannot have created him, no indeed, only to make a few happy and condemn hundreds to eternal misery, and all in a moment, for hereditary faults! No! If that be true, strangle your baby son sleeping there! If such a belief were not a blasphemy against that God, who must be the Highest Good, then the Phenician Moloch, which was appeased with human sacrifices and innocent blood, and in whose belly were burned the babes torn from their mothers’ breasts, that bloody deity, that horrible divinity, would be by the side of Him a weak girl, a friend, a mother of humanity!”\nHorrified, the Lunatic—or the Sage—left the house and ran along the street in spite of the rain and the darkness. A lurid flash, followed by frightful thunder and filling the air with deadly currents, lighted the old man as he stretched his hand toward the sky and cried out: “Thou protestest! I know that Thou art not cruel, I know that I must only name Thee Good!”\nThe flashes of lightning became more frequent and the storm increased in violence.\n[1] St. Barbara is invoked during thunder-storms as the special protectress against lightning.—TR.\n[2] In possibility (i.e., latent) and not: in fact.—TR.\n[3] “For this are various penances enjoined;\nAnd some are hung to bleach upon the wind;\nSome plunged in waters, others purged in fires,\nTill all the dregs are drained, and all the rust expires.”\nDryden, Virgil’s Aeneid, VI.\n[4] “Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.”—Luke xxiii, 43.\n[5] It should be believed that for some light faults there is a purgatorial fire before the judgment.\n[6] Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth.—Matt, xvi, 19.\n[7] Even up to purgatory.\n Chapter XV – The Sacristans The thunder resounded, roar following close upon roar, each preceded’ by a blinding flash of zigzag lightning, so that it might have been said that God was writing his name in fire and that the eternal arch of heaven was trembling with fear. The rain, whipped about in a different direction each moment by the mournfully whistling wind, fell in torrents. With a voice full of fear the bells sounded their sad supplication, and in the brief pauses between the roars of the unchained elements tolled forth sorrowful peals, like plaintive groans.\nOn the second floor of the church tower were the two boys whom we saw talking to the Sage. The younger, a child of seven years with large black eyes and a timid countenance, was huddling close to his brother, a boy of ten, whom he greatly resembled in features, except that the look on the elder’s face was deeper and firmer.\nBoth were meanly dressed in clothes full of rents and patches. They sat upon a block of wood, each holding the end of a rope which extended upward and was lost amid the shadows above. The wind-driven rain reached them and snuffed the piece of candle burning dimly on the large round stone that was used to furnish the thunder on Good Friday by being rolled around the gallery.\n“Pull on the rope, Crispin, pull!” cried the elder to his little brother, who did as he was told, so that from above was heard a faint peal, instantly drowned out by the reechoing thunder.\n“Oh, if we were only at home now with mother,” sighed the younger, as he gazed at his brother. “There I shouldn’t be afraid.”\nThe elder did not answer; he was watching the melting wax of the candle, apparently lost in thought.\n“There no one would say that I stole,” went on Crispin. “Mother wouldn’t allow it. If she knew that they whip me—”\nThe elder took his gaze from the flame, raised his head, and clutching the thick rope pulled violently on it so that a sonorous peal of the bells was heard.\n“Are we always going to live this way, brother?” continued Crispin. “I’d like to get sick at home tomorrow, I’d like to fall into a long sickness so that mother might take care of me and not let me come back to the convento. So I’d not be called a thief nor would they whip me. And you too, brother, you must get sick with me.”\n“No,” answered the older, “we should all die: mother of grief and we of hunger.”\nCrispin remained silent for a moment, then asked, “How much will you get this month?”\n“Two pesos. They’re fined me twice.”\n“Then pay what they say I’ve stolen, so that they won’t call us thieves. Pay it, brother!”\n“Are you crazy, Crispin? Mother wouldn’t have anything to eat. The senior sacristan says that you’ve stolen two gold pieces, and they’re worth thirty-two pesos.”\nThe little one counted on his fingers up to thirty-two. “Six hands and two fingers over and each finger a peso!” he murmured thoughtfully. “And each peso, how many cuartos?”\n“A hundred and sixty.”\n“A hundred and sixty cuartos? A hundred and sixty times a cuarto? Goodness! And how many are a hundred and sixty?”\n“Thirty-two hands,” answered the older.\nCrispin looked hard at his little hands. “Thirty-two hands,” he repeated, “six hands and two fingers over and each finger thirty-two hands and each finger a cuarto—goodness, what a lot of cuartos! I could hardly count them in three days; and with them could be bought shoes for our feet, a hat for my head when the sun shines hot, a big umbrella for the rain, and food, and clothes for you and mother, and—” He became silent and thoughtful again.\n“Now I’m sorry that I didn’t steal!” he soon exclaimed.\n“Crispin!” reproached his brother.\n“Don’t get angry! The curate has said that he’ll beat me to death if the money doesn’t appear, and if I had stolen it I could make it appear. Anyhow, if I died you and mother would at least have clothes. Oh, if I had only stolen it!”\nThe elder pulled on the rope in silence. After a time he replied with a sigh: “What I’m afraid of is that mother will scold you when she knows about it.”\n“Do you think so?” asked the younger with astonishment. “You will tell her that they’re whipped me and I’ll show the welts on my back and my torn pocket. I had only one cuarto, which was given to me last Easter, but the curate took that away from me yesterday. I never saw a prettier cuarto! No, mother won’t believe it.”\n“If the curate says so—”\nCrispin began to cry, murmuring between his sobs, “Then go home alone! I don’t want to go. Tell mother that I’m sick. I don’t want to go.”\n“Crispin, don’t cry!” pleaded the elder. “Mother won’t believe it—don’t cry! Old Tasio told us that a fine supper is waiting for us.”\n“A fine supper! And I haven’t eaten for a long time. They won’t give me anything to eat until the two gold pieces appear. But, if mother believes it? You must tell her that the senior sacristan is a liar but that the curate believes him and that all of them are liars, that they say that we’re thieves because our father is a vagabond who—”\n[104]At that instant a head appeared at the top of the stairway leading down to the floor below, and that head, like Medusa’s, froze the words on the child’s lips. It was a long, narrow head covered with black hair, with blue glasses concealing the fact that one eye was sightless. The senior sacristan was accustomed to appear thus without noise or warning of any kind. The two brothers turned cold with fear.\n“On you, Basilio, I impose a fine of two reals for not ringing the bells in time,” he said in a voice so hollow that his throat seemed to lack vocal chords. “You, Crispin, must stay tonight, until what you stole reappears.”\nCrispin looked at his brother as if pleading for protection.\n“But we already have permission—mother expects us at eight o’clock,” objected Basilio timidly.\n“Neither shall you go home at eight, you’ll stay until ten.”\n“But, sir, after nine o’clock no one is allowed to be out and our house is far from here.”\n“Are you trying to give me orders?” growled the man irritably, as he caught Crispin by the arm and started to drag him away.\n“Oh, sir, it’s been a week now since we’re seen our mother,” begged Basilio, catching hold of his brother as if to defend him.\nThe senior sacristan struck his hand away and jerked at Crispin, who began to weep as he fell to the floor, crying out to his brother, “Don’t leave me, they’re going to kill me!”\nThe sacristan gave no heed to this and dragged him on to the stairway. As they disappeared among the shadows below Basilio stood speechless, listening to the sounds of his brother’s body striking against the steps. Then followed the sound of a blow and heartrending cries that died away in the distance.\nThe boy stood on tiptoe, hardly breathing and listening fixedly, with his eyes unnaturally wide and his fists clenched. “When shall I be strong enough to plow a field?” he muttered between his teeth as he started below hastily. Upon reaching the organ-loft he paused to listen; the voice of his brother was fast dying away in the distance and the cries of “Mother! Brother!” were at last completely cut off by the sound of a closing door. Trembling and perspiring, he paused for a moment with his fist in his mouth to keep down a cry of anguish. He let his gaze wander about the dimly lighted church where an oil-lamp gave a ghostly light, revealing the catafalque in the center. The doors were closed and fastened, and the windows had iron bars on them. Suddenly he reascended the stairway to the place where the candle was burning and then climbed up into the third floor of the belfry. After untying the ropes from the bell-clappers he again descended. He was pale and his eyes glistened, but not with tears.\nMeanwhile, the rain was gradually ceasing and the sky was clearing. Basilio knotted the ropes together, tied one end to a rail of the balustrade, and without even remembering to put out the light let himself down into the darkness outside. A few moments later voices were heard on one of the streets of the town, two shots resounded, but no one seemed to be alarmed and silence again reigned.\n Chapter XVI – Sisa Through the dark night the villagers slept. The families who had remembered their dead gave themselves up to quiet and satisfied sleep, for they had recited their requiems, the novena of the souls, and had burned many wax tapers before the sacred images. The rich and powerful had discharged the duties their positions imposed upon them. On the following day they would hear three masses said by each priest and would give two pesos for another, besides buying a bull of indulgences for the dead. Truly, divine justice is not nearly so exacting as human.\nBut the poor and indigent who earn scarcely enough to keep themselves alive and who also have to pay tribute to the petty officials, clerks, and soldiers, that they may be allowed to live in peace, sleep not so tranquilly as gentle poets who have perhaps not felt the pinches of want would have us believe. The poor are sad and thoughtful, for on that night, if they have not recited many prayers, yet they have prayed much—with pain in their eyes and tears in their hearts. They have not the novenas, nor do they know the responsories, versicles, and prayers which the friars have composed for those who lack original ideas and feelings, nor do they understand them. They pray in the language of their misery: their souls weep for them and for those dead beings whose love was their wealth. Their lips may proffer the salutations, but their minds cry out complaints, charged with lamentations. Wilt Thou be satisfied, O Thou who blessedst poverty, and you, O suffering souls, with the simple prayers of the poor, offered before a rude picture in the light of a dim wick, or do you perhaps desire wax tapers before bleeding Christs and Virgins with small mouths and crystal eyes, and masses in Latin recited mechanically by priests? And thou, Religion preached for suffering humanity, hast thou forgotten thy mission of consoling the oppressed in their misery and of humiliating the powerful in their pride? Hast thou now promises only for the rich, for those who, can pay thee?\nThe poor widow watches among the children who sleep at her side. She is thinking of the indulgences that she ought to buy for the repose of the souls of her parents and of her dead husband. “A peso,” she says, “a peso is a week of happiness for my children, a week of laughter and joy, my savings for a month, a dress for my daughter who is becoming a woman.” “But it is necessary that you put aside these worldly desires,” says the voice that she heard in the pulpit, “it is necessary that you make sacrifices.” Yes, it is necessary. The Church does not gratuitously save the beloved souls for you nor does it distribute indulgences without payment. You must buy them, so tonight instead of sleeping you should work. Think of your daughter, so poorly clothed! Fast, for heaven is dear! Decidedly, it seems that the poor enter not into heaven. Such thoughts wander through the space enclosed between the rough mats spread out on the bamboo floor and the ridge of the roof, from which hangs the hammock wherein the baby swings. The infant’s breathing is easy and peaceful, but from time to time he swallows and smacks his lips; his hungry stomach, which is not satisfied with what his older brothers have given him, dreams of eating.\nThe cicadas chant monotonously, mingling their ceaseless notes with the trills of the cricket hidden in the grass, or the chirp of the little lizard which has come out in search of food, while the big gekko, no longer fearing the water, disturbs the concert with its ill-omened voice as it shows its head from out the hollow of the decayed tree-trunk.\nThe dogs howl mournfully in the streets and superstitious folk, hearing them, are convinced that they see spirits and ghosts. But neither the dogs nor the other animals see the sorrows of men—yet how many of these exist!\nDistant from the town an hour’s walk lives the mother of Basilio and Crispin. The wife of a heartless man, she struggles to live for her sons, while her husband is a vagrant gamester with whom her interviews are rare but always painful. He has gradually stripped her of her few jewels to pay the cost of his vices, and when the suffering Sisa no longer had anything that he might take to satisfy his whims, he had begun to maltreat her. Weak in character, with more heart than intellect, she knew only how to love and to weep. Her husband was a god and her sons were his angels, so he, knowing to what point he was loved and feared, conducted himself like all false gods: daily he became more cruel, more inhuman, more wilful. Once when he had appeared with his countenance gloomier than ever before, Sisa had consulted him about the plan of making a sacristan of Basilio, and he had merely continued to stroke his game-cock, saying neither yes nor no, only asking whether the boy would earn much money. She had not dared to insist, but her needy situation and her desire that the boys should learn to read and write in the town school forced her to carry out the plan. Still her husband had said nothing.\nThat night, between ten and eleven o’clock, when the stars were glittering in a sky now cleared of all signs of the storm of the early evening, Sisa sat on a wooden bench watching some fagots that smouldered upon the fireplace fashioned of rough pieces of natural rock. Upon a tripod, or tunko, was a small pot of boiling rice and upon the red coals lay three little dried fishes such as are sold at three for two cuartos. Her chin rested in the palm of her hand while she gazed at the weak yellow glow peculiar to the cane, which burns rapidly and leaves embers that quickly grow pale. A sad smile lighted up her face as she recalled a funny riddle about the pot and the fire which Crispin had once propounded to her. The boy said: “The black man sat down and the red man looked at him, a moment passed, and cock-a-doodle-doo rang forth.”\nSisa was still young, and it was plain that at one time she had been pretty and attractive. Her eyes, which, like her disposition, she had given to her sons, were beautiful, with long lashes and a deep look. Her nose was regular and her pale lips curved pleasantly. She was what the Tagalogs call kayumanguing-kaligátan; that is, her color was a clear, pure brown. In spite of her youthfulness, pain and perhaps even hunger had begun to make hollow her pallid cheeks, and if her abundant hair, in other times the delight and adornment of her person, was even yet simply and neatly arranged, though without pins or combs, it was not from coquetry but from habit.\nSisa had been for several days confined to the house sewing upon some work which had been ordered for the earliest possible time. In order to earn the money, she had not attended mass that morning, as it would have taken two hours at least to go to the town and return: poverty obliges one to sin! She had finished the work and delivered it but had received only a promise of payment. All that day she had been anticipating the pleasures of the evening, for she knew that her sons were coming and she had intended to make them some presents. She had bought some small fishes, picked the most beautiful tomatoes in her little garden, as she knew that Crispin was very fond of them, and begged from a neighbor, old Tasio the Sage, who lived half a mile away, some slices of dried wild boar’s meat and a leg of wild duck, which Basilio especially liked. Full of hope, she had cooked the whitest of rice, which she herself had gleaned from the threshing-floors. It was indeed a curate’s meal for the poor boys.\nBut by an unfortunate chance her husband came and ate the rice, the slices of wild boar’s meat, the duck leg, five of the little fishes, and the tomatoes. Sisa said nothing, although she felt as if she herself were being eaten. His hunger at length appeased, he remembered to ask for the boys. Then Sisa smiled happily and resolved that she would not eat that night, because what remained was not enough for three. The father had asked for their sons and that for her was better than eating.\nSoon he picked up his game-cock and started away.\n“Don’t you want to see them?” she asked tremulously. “Old Tasio told me that they would be a little late. Crispin now knows how to read and perhaps Basilio will bring his wages.”\nThis last reason caused the husband to pause and waver, but his good angel triumphed. “In that case keep a peso for me,” he said as he went away.\nSisa wept bitterly, but the thought of her sons soon dried her tears. She cooked some more rice and prepared the only three fishes that were left: each would have one and a half. “They’ll have good appetites,” she mused, “the way is long and hungry stomachs have no heart.”\nSo she sat, he ear strained to catch every sound, listening to the lightest footfalls: strong and clear, Basilio; light and irregular, Crispin—thus she mused. The kalao called in the woods several times after the rain had ceased, but still her sons did not come. She put the fishes inside the pot to keep them warm and went to the threshold of the hut to look toward the road. To keep herself company, she began to sing in a low voice, a voice usually so sweet and tender that when her sons listened to her singing the kundíman they wept without knowing why, but tonight it trembled and the notes were halting. She stopped singing and gazed earnestly into the darkness, but no one was coming from the town—that noise was only the wind shaking the raindrops from the wide banana leaves.\nSuddenly a black dog appeared before her dragging something along the path. Sisa was frightened but caught up a stone and threw it at the dog, which ran away howling mournfully. She was not superstitious, but she had heard so much about presentiments and black dogs that terror seized her. She shut the door hastily and sat down by the light. Night favors credulity and the imagination peoples the air with specters. She tried to pray, to call upon the Virgin and upon God to watch over her sons, especially her little Crispin. Then she forgot her prayers as her thoughts wandered to think about them, to recall the features of each, those features that always wore a smile for her both asleep and awake. Suddenly she felt her hair rise on her head and her eyes stared wildly; illusion or reality, she saw Crispin standing by the fireplace, there where he was wont to sit and prattle to her, but now he said nothing as he gazed at her with those large, thoughtful eyes, and smiled.\n“Mother, open the door! Open, mother!” cried the voice of Basilio from without.\nSisa shuddered violently and the vision disappeared.\n Chapter XVII – Basilio  La vida es sueño.\n Basilio was scarcely inside when he staggered and fell into his mother’s arms. An inexplicable chill seized Sisa as she saw him enter alone. She wanted to speak but could make no sound; she wanted to embrace her son but lacked the strength; to weep was impossible. At sight of the blood which covered the boy’s forehead she cried in a tone that seemed to come from a breaking heart, “My sons!”\n“Don’t be afraid, mother,” Basilio reassured her. “Crispin stayed at the convento.”\n“At the convento? He stayed at the convento? Is he alive?”\nThe boy raised his eyes to her. “Ah!” she sighed, passing from the depths of sorrow to the heights of joy. She wept and embraced her son, covering his bloody forehead with kisses.\n“Crispin is alive! You left him at the convento! But why are you wounded, my son? Have you had a fall?” she inquired, as she examined him anxiously.\n“The senior sacristan took Crispin away and told me that I could not leave until ten o’clock, but it was already late and so I ran away. In the town the soldiers challenged me, I started to run, they fired, and a bullet grazed my forehead. I was afraid they would arrest me and beat me and make me scrub out the barracks, as they did with Pablo, who is still sick from it.”\n“My God, my God!” murmured his mother, shuddering. “Thou hast saved him!” Then while she sought for bandages, water, vinegar, and a feather, she went on, “A finger’s breadth more and they would have killed you, they would have killed my boy! The civil-guards do not think of the mothers.”\n“You must say that I fell from a tree so that no one will know they chased me,” Basilio cautioned her.\n“Why did Crispin stay?” asked Sisa, after dressing her son’s wound.\nBasilio hesitated a few moments, then with his arms about her and their tears mingling, he related little by little the story of the gold pieces, without speaking, however, of the tortures they were inflicting upon his young brother.\n“My good Crispin! To accuse my good Crispin! It’s because we’re poor and we poor people have to endure everything!” murmured Sisa, staring through her tears at the light of the lamp, which was now dying out from lack of oil. So they remained silent for a while.\n“Haven’t you had any supper yet? Here are rice and fish.”\n“I don’t want anything, only a little water.”\n“Yes,” answered his mother sadly, “I know that you don’t like dried fish. I had prepared something else, but your father came.”\n“Father came?” asked Basilio, instinctively examining the face and hands of his mother.\nThe son’s questioning gaze pained Sisa’s heart, for she understood it only too well, so she added hastily: “He came and asked a lot about you and wanted to see you, and he was very hungry. He said that if you continued to be so good he would come back to stay with us.”\nAn exclamation of disgust from Basilio’s contracted lips interrupted her. “Son!” she reproached him.\n“Forgive me, mother,” he answered seriously. “But aren’t we three better off—you, Crispin, and I? You’re crying—I haven’t said anything.”\nSisa sighed and asked, “Aren’t you going to eat? Then let’s go to sleep, for it’s now very late.” She then closed up the hut and covered the few coals with ashes so that the fire would not die out entirely, just as a man does with his inner feelings; he covers them with the ashes of his life, which he calls indifference, so that they may not be deadened by daily contact with his fellows.\nBasilio murmured his prayers and lay down near his mother, who was upon her knees praying. He felt hot and cold, he tried to close his eyes as he thought of his little brother who that night had expected to sleep in his mother’s lap and who now was probably trembling with terror and weeping in some dark corner of the convento. His ears were again pierced with those cries he had heard in the church tower. But wearied nature soon began to confuse his ideas and the veil of sleep descended upon his eyes.\nHe saw a bedroom where two dim tapers burned. The curate, with a rattan whip in his hand, was listening gloomily to something that the senior sacristan was telling him in a strange tongue with horrible gestures. Crispin quailed and turned his tearful eyes in every direction as if seeking some one or some hiding-place. The curate turned toward him and called to him irritably, the rattan whistled. The child ran to hide himself behind the sacristan, who caught and held him, thus exposing him to the curate’s fury. The unfortunate boy fought, kicked, screamed, threw himself on the floor and rolled about. He picked himself up, ran, slipped, fell, and parried the blows with his hands, which, wounded, he hid quickly, all the time shrieking with pain. Basilio saw him twist himself, strike the floor with his head, he saw and heard the rattan whistle. In desperation his little brother rose. Mad with pain he threw himself upon his tormentor and bit him on the hand. The curate gave a cry and dropped the rattan—the sacristan caught up a heavy cane and struck the boy a blow on the head so that he fell stunned—the curate, seeing him down, trampled him with his feet. But the child no longer defended himself nor did he cry out; he rolled along the floor, a lifeless mass that left a damp track.[1]\nSisa’s voice brought him back to reality. “What’s the matter? Why are you crying?”\n“I dreamed—O God!” exclaimed Basilio, sitting up, covered with perspiration. “It was a dream! Tell me, mother, that it was only a dream! Only a dream!”\n“What did you dream?”\nThe boy did not answer, but sat drying his tears and wiping away the perspiration. The hut was in total darkness.\n“A dream, a dream!” repeated Basilio in subdued tones.\n“Tell me what you dreamed. I can’t sleep,” said his mother when he lay down again.\n“Well,” he said in a low voice, “I dreamed that we had gone to glean the rice-stalks—in a field where there were many flowers—the women had baskets full of rice-stalks the men too had baskets full of rice-stalks—and the children too—I don’t remember any more, mother, I don’t remember the rest.”\nSisa had no faith in dreams, so she did not insist.\n“Mother, I’ve thought of a plan tonight,” said Basilio after a few moments’ silence.\n“What is your plan?” she asked. Sisa was humble in everything, even with her own sons, trusting their judgment more than her own.\n“I don’t want to be a sacristan any longer.”\n“What?”\n“Listen, mother, to what I’ve been thinking about. Today there arrived from Spain the son of the dead Don Rafael, and he will be a good man like his father. Well now, mother, tomorrow you will get Crispin, collect my wages, and say that I will not be a sacristan any longer. As soon as I get well I’ll go to see Don Crisostomo and ask him to hire me as a herdsman of his cattle and carabaos—I’m now big enough. Crispin can study with old Tasio, who does not whip and who is a good man, even if the curate does not believe so. What have we to fear now from the padre? Can he make us any poorer than we are? You may believe it, mother, the old man is good. I’ve seen him often in the church when no one else was about, kneeling and praying, believe it. So, mother, I’ll stop being a sacristan. I earn but little and that little is taken away from me in fines. Every one complains of the same thing. I’ll be a herdsman and by performing my tasks carefully I’ll make my employer like me. Perhaps he’ll let us milk a cow so that we can drink milk—Crispin likes milk so much. Who can tell! Maybe they’ll give us a little calf if they see that I behave well and we’ll take care of it and fatten it like our hen. I’ll pick fruits in the woods and sell them in the town along with the vegetables from our garden, so we’ll have money. I’ll set snares and traps to catch birds and wild cats,[2] I’ll fish in the river, and when I’m bigger, I’ll hunt. I’ll be able also to cut firewood to sell or to present to the owner of the cows, and so he’ll be satisfied with us. When I’m able to plow, I’ll ask him to let me have a piece of land to plant in sugar-cane or corn and you won’t have to sew until midnight. We’ll have new clothes for every fiesta, we’ll eat meat and big fish, we’ll live free, seeing each other every day and eating together. Old Tasio says that Crispin has a good head and so we’ll send him to Manila to study. I’ll support him by working hard. Isn’t that fine, mother? Perhaps he’ll be a doctor, what do you say?”\n“What can I say but yes?” said Sisa as she embraced her son. She noted, however, that in their future the boy took no account of his father, and shed silent tears.\nBasilio went on talking of his plans with the confidence of the years that see only what they wish for. To everything Sisa said yes—everything appeared good.\nSleep again began to weigh down upon the tired eyelids of the boy, and this time Ole-Luk-Oie, of whom Andersen tells us, spread over him his beautiful umbrella with its pleasing pictures. Now he saw himself with his little brother as they picked guavas, alpay, and other fruits in the woods; they clambered from branch to branch, light as butterflies; they penetrated into the caves and saw the shining rocks; they bathed in the springs where the sand was gold-dust and the stones like the jewels in the Virgin’s crown. The little fishes sang and laughed, the plants bent their branches toward them laden with golden fruit. Then he saw a bell hanging in a tree with a long rope for ringing it; to the rope was tied a cow with a bird’s nest between her horns and Crispin was inside the bell.\nThus he went on dreaming, while his mother, who was not of his age and who had not run for an hour, slept not.\n [1] Dream or reality, we do not know whether this may have happened to any Franciscan, but something similar is related of the Augustinian Padre Piernavieja.—Author’s note.\nFray Antonio Piernavieja, O.S.A., was a parish curate in the province of Bulacan when this work was written. Later, on account of alleged brutality similar to the incident used here, he was transferred to the province of Cavite, where, in 1896, he was taken prisoner by the insurgents and by them made “bishop” of their camp. Having taken advantage of this position to collect and forward to the Spanish authorities in Manila information concerning the insurgents’ preparations and plans, he was tied out in an open field and left to perish of hunger and thirst under the tropical sun. See Guía Oficial de Filipinas, 1885, p. 195; El Katipunan ó El Filibusterismo en Filipinas (Madrid, 1897), p. 347; Foreman’s The Philippine Islands, Chap. XII.—TR.\n[2] The Philippine civet-cat, quite rare, and the only wild carnivore in the Philippine Islands.—TR.\n Chapter XVIII – Souls in Torment It was about seven o’clock in the morning when Fray Salvi finished celebrating his last mass, having offered up three in the space of an hour. “The padre is ill,” commented the pious women. “He doesn’t move about with his usual slowness and elegance of manner.”\nHe took off his vestments without the least comment, without saying a word or looking at any one. “Attention!” whispered the sacristans among themselves. “The devil’s to pay! It’s going to rain fines, and all on account of those two brothers.”\nHe left the sacristy to go up into the rectory, in the hallway of which there awaited him some seven or eight women seated upon benches and a man who was pacing back and forth. Upon seeing him approach, the women arose and one of them pressed forward to kiss his hand, but the holy man made a sign of impatience that stopped her short.\n“Can it be that you’ve lost a real, kuriput?” exclaimed the woman with a jesting laugh, offended at such a reception. “Not to give his hand to me, Matron of the Sisterhood, Sister Rufa!” It was an unheard-of proceeding.\n“He didn’t go into the confessional this morning,” added Sister Sipa, a toothless old woman. “I wanted to confess myself so as to receive communion and get the indulgences.”\n“Well, I’m sorry for you,” commented a young woman with a frank face. “This week I earned three plenary indulgences and dedicated them to the soul of my husband.”\n“Badly done, Sister Juana,” said the offended Rufa. “One plenary indulgence was enough to get him out of purgatory. You ought not to squander the holy indulgences. Do as I do.”\n“I thought, so many more the better,” answered the simple Sister Juana, smiling. “But tell me what you do.”\nSister Rufa did not answer at once. First, she asked for a buyo and chewed at it, gazed at her audience, which was listening attentively, then spat to one side and commenced, chewing at the buyo meanwhile: “I don’t misspend one holy day! Since I’ve belonged to the Sisterhood I’ve earned four hundred and fifty-seven plenary indulgences, seven hundred sixty thousand five hundred and ninety-eight years of indulgence. I set down all that I earn, for I like to have clean accounts. I don’t want to cheat or be cheated.”\nHere Sister Rufa paused to give more attention to her chewing. The women gazed at her in admiration, but the man who was pacing back and forth remarked with some disdain, “Well, this year I’ve gained four plenary indulgences more than you have, Sister Rufa, and a hundred years more, and that without praying much either.”\n“More than I? More than six hundred and eighty-nine plenary indulgences or nine hundred ninety-four thousand eight hundred and fifty-six years?” queried Rufa, somewhat disgruntled.\n“That’s it, eight indulgences and a hundred fifteen years more and a few months over,” answered the man, from whose neck hung soiled scapularies and rosaries.\n“That’s not strange!” admitted Rufa, at last admitting defeat. “You’re an expert, the best in the province.”\nThe flattered man smiled and continued, “It isn’t so wonderful that I earn more than you do. Why, I can almost say that even when sleeping I earn indulgences.”\n“And what do you do with them, sir?” asked four or five voices at the same time.\n“Pish!” answered the man with a gesture of proud disdain. “I have them to throw away!”\n“But in that I can’t commend you, sir,” protested Rufa. “You’ll go to purgatory for wasting the indulgences. You know very well that for every idle word one must suffer forty days in fire, according to the curate; for every span of thread uselessly wasted, sixty days; and for every drop of water spilled, twenty. You’ll go to purgatory.”\n“Well, I’ll know how to get out,” answered Brother Pedro with sublime confidence. “How many souls have I saved from the flames! How many saints have I made! Besides, even in articulo mortis I can still earn, if I wish, at least seven plenary indulgences and shall be able to save others as I die.” So saying, he strode proudly away.\nSister Rufa turned to the others: “Nevertheless, you must do as I do, for I don’t lose a single day and I keep my accounts well. I don’t want to cheat or be cheated.”\n“Well, what do you do?” asked Juana.\n“You must imitate what I do. For example, suppose I earn a year of indulgence: I set it down in my account-book and say, ‘Most Blessed Father and Lord St. Dominic, please see if there is anybody in purgatory who needs exactly a year—neither a day more nor a day less.’ Then I play heads and tails: if it comes heads, no; if tails, yes. Let’s suppose that it comes tails, then I write down paid; if it comes heads, then I keep the indulgence. In this way I arrange groups of a hundred years each, of which I keep a careful account. It’s a pity that we can’t do with them as with money—put them out at interest, for in that way we should be able to save more souls. Believe me, and do as I do.”\n“Well, I do it a better way,” remarked Sister Sipa.\n“What? Better?” demanded the astonished Rufa. “That can’t be! My system can’t be improved upon!”\n“Listen a moment and you’ll be convinced, Sister,” said old Sipa in a tone of vexation.\n“How is it? Let’s hear!” exclaimed the others.\nAfter coughing ceremoniously the old woman began with great care: “You know very well that by saying the Bendita sea tu pureza and the Señor mío Jesucristo, Padre dulcísimo por el gozo, ten years are gained for each letter—”\n“Twenty!” “No, less!” “Five!” interrupted several voices.\n“A few years more or less make no difference. Now, when a servant breaks a plate, a glass, or a cup, I make him pick up the pieces; and for every scrap, even the very smallest, he has to recite for me one of those prayers. The indulgences that I earn in this way I devote to the souls. Every one in my house, except the cats, understands this system.”\n“But those indulgences are earned by the servants and not by you, Sister Sipa,” objected Rufa.\n“And my cups and plates, who pays for them? The servants are glad to pay for them in that way and it suits me also. I never resort to blows, only sometimes a pinch, or a whack on the head.”\n“I’m going to do as you do!” “I’ll do the same!” “And I!” exclaimed the women.\n“But suppose the plate is only broken into two or three pieces, then you earn very few,” observed the obstinate Rufa.\n“Abá!” answered old Sipa. “I make them recite the prayers anyhow. Then I glue the pieces together again and so lose nothing.”\nSister Rufa had no more objections left.\n“Allow me to ask about a doubt of mine,” said young Juana timidly. “You ladies understand so well these matters of heaven, purgatory, and hell, while I confess that I’m ignorant. Often I find in the novenas and other books this direction: three paternosters, three Ave Marias, and three Gloria Patris—”\n“Yes, well?”\n“Now I want to know how they should be recited: whether three paternosters in succession, three Ave Marias in succession, and three Gloria Patris in succession; or a paternoster, an Ave Maria, and a Gloria Patri together, three times?”\n“This way: a paternoster three times—”\n“Pardon me, Sister Sipa,” interrupted Rufa, “they must be recited in the other way. You mustn’t mix up males and females. The paternosters are males, the Ave Marias are females, and the Gloria Patris are the children.”\n“Eh? Excuse me, Sister Rufa: paternoster, Ave Maria, and Gloria are like rice, meat, and sauce—a mouthful for the saints—”\n“You’re wrong! You’ll see, for you who pray that way will never get what you ask for.”\n“And you who pray the other way won’t get anything from your novenas,” replied old Sipa.\n“Who won’t?” asked Rufa, rising. “A short time ago I lost a little pig, I prayed to St. Anthony and found it, and then I sold it for a good price. Abá!”\n“Yes? Then that’s why one of your neighbors was saying that you sold a pig of hers.”\n“Who? The shameless one! Perhaps I’m like you—”\nHere the expert had to interfere to restore peace, for no one was thinking any more about paternosters—the talk was all about pigs. “Come, come, there mustn’t be any quarrel over a pig, Sisters! The Holy Scriptures give us an example to follow. The heretics and Protestants didn’t quarrel with Our Lord for driving into the water a herd of swine that belonged to them, and we that are Christians and besides, Brethren of the Holy Rosary, shall we have hard words on account of a little pig! What would our rivals, the Tertiary Brethren, say?”\nAll became silent before such wisdom, at the same time fearing what the Tertiary Brethren might say. The expert, well satisfied with such acquiescence, changed his tone and continued: “Soon the curate will send for us. We must tell him which preacher we’ve chosen of the three that he suggested yesterday, whether Padre Damaso, Padre Martin, or the coadjutor. I don’t know whether the Tertiary Brethren have yet made any choice, so we must decide.”\n“The coadjutor,” murmured Juana timidly.\n“Ahem! The coadjutor doesn’t know how to preach,” declared Sipa. “Padre Martin is better.”\n“Padre Martin!” exclaimed another disdainfully. “He hasn’t any voice. Padre Damaso would be better.”\n“That’s right!” cried Rufa. “Padre Damaso surely does know how to preach! He looks like a comedian!”\n“But we don’t understand him,” murmured Juana.\n“Because he’s very deep! And as he preaches well—”\nThis speech was interrupted by the arrival of Sisa, who was carrying a basket on her head. She saluted the Sisters and went on up the stairway.\n“She’s going in! Let’s go in too!” they exclaimed. Sisa felt her heart beating violently as she ascended the stairs. She did not know just what to say to the padre to placate his wrath or what reasons she could advance in defense of her son. That morning at the first flush of dawn she had gone into her garden to pick the choicest vegetables, which she placed in a basket among banana-leaves and flowers; then she had looked along the bank of the river for the pakó which she knew the curate liked for salads. Putting on her best clothes and without awakening her son, she had set out for the town with the basket on her head. As she went up the stairway she, tried to make as little noise as possible and listened attentively in the hope that she might hear a fresh, childish voice, so well known to her. But she heard nothing nor did she meet any one as she made her way to the kitchen. There she looked into all the corners. The servants and sacristans received her coldly, scarcely acknowledging her greeting.\n“Where can I put these vegetables?” she asked, not taking any offense at their coldness.\n“There, anywhere!” growled the cook, hardly looking at her as he busied himself in picking the feathers from a capon.\nWith great care Sisa arranged the vegetables and the salad leaves on the table, placing the flowers above them. Smiling, she then addressed one of the servants, who seemed to be more approachable than the cook: “May I speak with the padre?”\n“He’s sick,” was the whispered answer.\n“And Crispin? Do you know if he is in the sacristy?” The servant looked surprised and wrinkled his eyebrows. “Crispin? Isn’t he at your house? Do you mean to deny it?”\n“Basilio is at home, but Crispin stayed here,” answered Sisa, “and I want to see him.”\n“Yes, he stayed, but afterwards he ran away, after stealing a lot of things. Early this morning the curate ordered me to go and report it to the Civil Guard. They must have gone to your house already to hunt for the boys.”\nSisa covered her ears and opened her mouth to speak, but her lips moved without giving out any sound.\n“A pretty pair of sons you have!” exclaimed the cook. “It’s plain that you’re a faithful wife, the sons are so like the father. Take care that the younger doesn’t surpass him.”\nSisa broke out into bitter weeping and let herself fall upon a bench.\n“Don’t cry here!” yelled the cook. “Don’t you know that the padre’s sick? Get out in the street and cry!”\nThe unfortunate mother was almost shoved down the stairway at the very time when the Sisters were coming down, complaining and making conjectures about the curate’s illness, so she hid her face in her pañuelo and suppressed the sounds of her grief. Upon reaching the street she looked about uncertainly for a moment and then, as if having reached a decision, walked rapidly away.\n Chapter XIX – A Schoolmaster’s Difficulties  El vulgo es necio y pues lo paga, es justo\nHablarle en necio para darle el gusto.[1]\nLOPE DE VEGA\n The mountain-encircled lake slept peacefully with that hypocrisy of the elements which gave no hint of how its waters had the night before responded to the fury of the storm. As the first reflections of light awoke on its surface the phosphorescent spirits, there were outlined in the distance, almost on the horizon, the gray silhouettes of the little bankas of the fishermen who were taking in their nets and of the larger craft spreading their sails. Two men dressed in deep mourning stood gazing at the water from a little elevation: one was Ibarra and the other a youth of humble aspect and melancholy features.\n“This is the place,” the latter was saying. “From here your father’s body was thrown into the water. Here’s where the grave-digger brought Lieutenant Guevara and me.”\nIbarra warmly grasped the hand of the young man, who went on: “You have no occasion to thank me. I owed many favors to your father, and the only thing that I could do for him was to accompany his body to the grave. I came here without knowing any one, without recommendation, and having neither name nor fortune, just as at present. My predecessor had abandoned the school to engage in the tobacco trade. Your father protected me, secured me a house, and furnished whatever was necessary for running the school. He used to visit the classes and distribute pictures among the poor but studious children, as well as provide them with books and paper. But this, like all good things, lasted only a little while.”\nIbarra took off his hat and seemed to be praying for a time. Then he turned to his companion: “Did you say that my father helped the poor children? And now?”\n“Now they get along as well as possible and write when they can,” answered the youth.\n“What is the reason?”\n“The reason lies in their torn camisas and their downcast eyes.”\n“How many pupils have you now?” asked Ibarra with interest, after a pause.\n“More than two hundred on the roll but only about twenty-five in actual attendance.”\n“How does that happen?”\nThe schoolmaster smiled sadly as he answered, “To tell you the reasons would make a long and tiresome story.”\n“Don’t attribute my question to idle curiosity,” replied Ibarra gravely, while he stared at the distant horizon. “I’ve thought better of it and believe that to carry out my father’s ideas will be more fitting than to weep for him, and far better than to revenge him. Sacred nature has become his grave, and his enemies were the people and a priest. The former I pardon on account of their ignorance and the latter because I wish that Religion, which elevated society, should be respected. I wish to be inspired with the spirit of him who gave me life and therefore desire to know about the obstacles encountered here in educational work.”\n“The country will bless your memory, sir,” said the schoolmaster, “if you carry out the beautiful plans of your dead father! You wish to know the obstacles which the progress of education meets? Well then, under present circumstances, without substantial aid education will never amount to much; in the very first place because, even when we have the pupils, lack of suitable means, and other things that attract them more, kill off their interest. It is said that in Germany a peasant’s son studies for eight years in the town school, but who here would spend half that time when such poor results are to be obtained? They read, write, and memorize selections, and sometimes whole books, in Spanish, without understanding a single word.[2] What benefit does our country child get from the school?”\n“And why have you, who see the evil, not thought of remedying it?”\nThe schoolmaster shook his head sadly. “A poor teacher struggles not only against prejudices but also against certain influences. First, it would be necessary to have a suitable place and not to do as I must at present—hold the classes under the convento by the side of the padre’s carriage. There the children, who like to read aloud, very naturally disturb the padre, and he often comes down, nervous, especially when he has his attacks, yells at them, and even insults me at times. You know that no one can either teach or learn under such circumstances, for the child will not respect his teacher when he sees him abused without standing up for his rights. In order to be heeded and to maintain his authority the teacher needs prestige, reputation, moral strength, and some freedom of action.\n“Now let me recount to you even sadder details. I have wished to introduce reforms and have been laughed at. In order to remedy the evil of which I just spoke to you, I tried to teach Spanish to the children because, in addition to the fact that the government so orders, I thought also that it would be of advantage for everybody. I used the simplest method of words and phrases without paying any attention to long rules, expecting to teach them grammar when they should understand the language. At the end of a few weeks some of the brightest were almost able to understand me and could use a few phrases.”\nThe schoolmaster paused and seemed to hesitate, then, as if making a resolution, he went on: “I must not be ashamed of the story of my wrongs, for any one in my place would have acted the same as I did. As I said, it was a good beginning, but a few days afterwards Padre Damaso, who was the curate then, sent for me by the senior sacristan. Knowing his disposition and fearing to make him wait, I went upstairs at once, saluted him, and wished him good-morning in Spanish. His only greeting had been to put out his hand for me to kiss, but at this he drew it back and without answering me began to laugh loud and mockingly. I was very much embarrassed, as the senior sacristan was present. At the moment I didn’t know just what to say, for the curate continued his laughter and I stood staring at him. Then I began to get impatient and saw that I was about to do something indiscreet, since to be a good Christian and to preserve one’s dignity are not incompatible. I was going to put a question to him when suddenly, passing from ridicule to insult, he said sarcastically, ‘So it’s buenos dins, eh? Buenos dias! How nice that you know how to talk Spanish!’ Then again he broke out into laughter.”\nIbarra was unable to repress a smile.\n“You smile,” continued the schoolmaster, following Ibarra’s example, “but I must confess that at the time I had very little desire to laugh. I was still standing—I felt the blood rush to my head and lightning seemed to flash through my brain. The curate I saw far, far away. I advanced to reply to him without knowing just what I was going to say, but the senior sacristan put himself between us. Padre Damaso arose and said to me in Tagalog: ‘Don’t try to shine in borrowed finery. Be content to talk your own dialect and don’t spoil Spanish, which isn’t meant for you. Do you know the teacher Ciruela?[3] Well, Ciruela was a teacher who didn’t know how to read, and he had a school.’ I wanted to detain him, but he went into his bedroom and slammed the door.\n“What was I to do with only my meager salary, to collect which I have to get the curate’s approval and make a trip to the capital of the province, what could I do against him, the foremost religious and political power in the town, backed up by his Order, feared by the government, rich, powerful, sought after and listened to, always believed and heeded by everybody? Although he insulted me, I had to remain silent, for if I replied he would have had me removed from my position, by which I should lose all hope in my chosen profession. Nor would the cause of education gain anything, but the opposite, for everybody would take the curate’s side, they would curse me and call me presumptuous, proud, vain, a bad Christian, uncultured, and if not those things, then anti-Spanish and a filibuster. Of a schoolmaster neither learning nor zeal is expected; resignation, humility, and inaction only are asked. May God pardon me if I have gone against my conscience and my judgement, but I was born in this country, I have to live, I have a mother, so I have abandoned myself to my fate like a corpse tossed about by the waves.”\n“Did this difficulty discourage you for all time? Have you lived so since?”\n“Would that it had been a warning to me! If only my troubles had been limited to that! It is true that from that time I began to dislike my profession and thought of seeking some other occupation, as my predecessor had done, because any work that is done in disgust and shame is a kind of martyrdom and because every day the school recalled the insult to my mind, causing me hours of great bitterness. But what was I to do? I could not undeceive my mother, I had to say to her that her three years of sacrifice to give me this profession now constituted my happiness. It is necessary to make her believe that this profession is most honorable, the work delightful, the way strewn with flowers, that the performance of my duties brings me only friendship, that the people respect me and show me every consideration. By doing otherwise, without ceasing to be unhappy myself, I should have caused more sorrow, which besides being useless would also be a sin. I stayed on, therefore, and tried not to feel discouraged. I tried to struggle on.”\nHere he paused for a while, then resumed: “From the day on which I was so grossly insulted I began to examine myself and I found that I was in fact very ignorant. I applied myself day and night to the study of Spanish and whatever concerned my profession. The old Sage lent me some books, and I read and pondered over everything that I could get hold of. With the new ideas that I have been acquiring in one place and another my point of view has changed and I have seen many things under a different aspect from what they had appeared to me before. I saw error where before I had seen only truth, and truth in many things where I had formerly seen only error. Corporal punishment, for example, which from time immemorial has been the distinctive feature in the schools and which has heretofore been considered as the only efficacious means of making pupils learn—so we have been accustomed to believe—soon appeared to me to be a great hindrance rather than in any way an aid to the child’s progress. I became convinced that it was impossible to use one’s mind properly when blows, or similar punishment, were in prospect. Fear and terror disturb the most serene, and a child’s imagination, besides being very lively, is also very impressionable. As it is on the brain that ideas are impressed, it is necessary that there be both inner and outer calm, that there be serenity of spirit, physical and moral repose, and willingness, so I thought that before everything else I should cultivate in the children confidence, assurance, and some personal pride. Moreover, I comprehended that the daily sight of floggings destroyed kindness in their hearts and deadened all sense of dignity, which is such a powerful lever in the world. At the same time it caused them to lose their sense of shame, which is a difficult thing to restore. I have also observed that when one pupil is flogged, he gets comfort from the fact that the others are treated in the same way, and that he smiles with satisfaction upon hearing the wails of the others. As for the person who does the flogging, while at first he may do it with repugnance, he soon becomes hardened to it and even takes delight in his gloomy task. The past filled me with horror, so I wanted to save the present by modifying the old system. I endeavored to make study a thing of love and joy, I wished to make the primer not a black book bathed in the tears of childhood but a friend who was going to reveal wonderful secrets, and of the schoolroom not a place of sorrows but a scene of intellectual refreshment. So, little by little, I abolished corporal punishment, taking the instruments of it entirely away from the school and replacing them with emulation and personal pride. If one was careless about his lesson, I charged it to lack of desire and never to lack of capacity. I made them think that they were more capable than they really were, which urged them on to study just as any confidence leads to notable achievements. At first it seemed that the change of method was impracticable; many ceased their studies, but I persisted and observed that little by little their minds were being elevated and that more children came, that they came with more regularity, and that he who was praised in the presence of the others studied with double diligence on the next day.\n“It soon became known throughout the town that I did not whip the children. The curate sent for me, and fearing another scene I greeted him curtly in Tagalog. On this occasion he was very serious with me. He said that I was exposing the children to destruction, that I was wasting time, that I was not fulfilling my duties, that the father who spared the rod was spoiling the child—according to the Holy Ghost—that learning enters with blood, and so on. He quoted to me sayings of barbarous times just as if it were enough that a thing had been said by the ancients to make it indisputable; according to which we ought to believe that there really existed those monsters which in past ages were imaged and sculptured in the palaces and temples. Finally, he charged me to be more careful and to return to the old system, otherwise he would make unfavorable report about me to the alcalde of the province. Nor was this the end of my troubles. A few days afterward some of the parents of the children presented themselves under the convento and I had to call to my aid all my patience and resignation. They began by reminding me of former times when teachers had character and taught as their grandfathers had. ‘Those indeed were the times of the wise men,’ they declared, ‘they whipped, and straightened the bent tree. They were not boys but old men of experience, gray-haired and severe. Don Catalino, king of them all and founder of this very school, used to administer no less than twenty-five blows and as a result his pupils became wise men and priests. Ah, the old people were worth more than we ourselves, yes, sir, more than we ourselves!’ Some did not content themselves with such indirect rudeness, but told me plainly that if I continued my system their children would learn nothing and that they would be obliged to take them from the school It was useless to argue with them, for as a young man they thought me incapable of sound judgment. What would I not have given for some gray hairs! They cited the authority of the curate, of this one and that one, and even called attention to themselves, saying that if it had not been for the whippings they had received from their teachers they would never have learned anything. Only a few persons showed any sympathy to sweeten for me the bitterness of such a disillusioning.\n“In view of all this I had to give up my system, which, after so much toil, was just beginning to produce results. In desperation I carried the whips bank to the school the next day and began the barbarous practice again. Serenity disappeared and sadness reigned in the faces of the children, who had just begun to care for me, and who were my only kindred and friends. Although I tried to spare the whippings and to administer them with all the moderation possible, yet the children felt the change keenly, they became discouraged and wept bitterly. It touched my heart, and even though in my own mind I was vexed with the stupid parents, still I was unable to take any spite out on those innocent victims of their parents’ prejudices. Their tears burned me, my heart seemed bursting from my breast, and that day I left the school before closing-time to go home and weep alone. Perhaps my sensitiveness may seem strange to you, but if you had been in my place you would understand it. Old Don Anastasio said to me, ‘So the parents want floggings? Why not inflict them on themselves?’ As a result of it all I became sick.” Ibarra was listening thoughtfully.\n“Scarcely had I recovered when I returned to the school to find the number of my pupils reduced to a fifth. The better ones had run away upon the return to the old system, and of those who remained—mostly those who came to school to escape work at home—not one showed any joy, not one congratulated me on my recovery. It would have been the same to them whether I got well or not, or they might have preferred that I continue sick since my substitute, although he whipped them more, rarely went to the school. My other pupils, those whose parents had obliged them to attend school, had gone to other places. Their parents blamed me for having spoiled them and heaped reproaches on me for it. One, however, the son of a country woman who visited me during my illness, had not returned on account of having been made a sacristan, and the senior sacristan says that the sacristans must not attend school: they would be dismissed.”\n“Were you resigned in looking after your new pupils?” asked Ibarra.\n“What else could I do?” was the queried reply. “Nevertheless, during my illness many things had happened, among them a change of curates, so I took new hope and made another attempt to the end that the children should not lose all their time and should, in so far as possible, get some benefit from the floggings, that such things might at least have some good result for them. I pondered over the matter, as I wished that even if they could not love me, by getting something useful from me, they might remember me with less bitterness. You know that in nearly all the schools the books are in Spanish, with the exception of the catechism in Tagalog, which varies according to the religious order to which the curate belongs. These books are generally novenas, canticles, and the Catechism of Padre Astete,[2] from which they learn about as much piety as they would from the books of heretics. Seeing the impossibility of teaching the pupils in Spanish or of translating so many books, I tried to substitute short passages from useful works in Tagalog, such as the Treatise on Manners by Hortensio y Feliza, some manuals of Agriculture, and so forth. Sometimes I would myself translate simple works, such as Padre Barranera’s History of the Philippines, which I then dictated to the children, with at times a few observations of my own, so that they might make note-books. As I had no maps for teaching geography, I copied one of the province that I saw at the capital and with this and the tiles of the floor I gave them some idea of the country. This time it was the women who got excited. The men contented themselves with smiling, as they saw in it only one of my vagaries. The new curate sent for me, and while he did not reprimand me, yet he said that I should first take care of religion, that before learning such things the children must pass an examination to show that they had memorized the mysteries, the canticles, and the catechism of Christian Doctrine.\n“So then, I am now working to the end that the children become changed into parrots and know by heart so many things of which they do not understand a single word. Many of them now know the mysteries and the canticles, but I fear that my efforts will come to grief with the Catechism of Padre Astete, since the greater part of the pupils do not distinguish between the questions and the answers, nor do they understand what either may mean. Thus we shall die, thus those unborn will do, while in Europe they will talk of progress.”\n“Let’s not be so pessimistic,” said Ibarra. “The teniente-mayor has sent me an invitation to attend a meeting in the town hall. Who knows but that there you may find an answer to your questions?”\nThe schoolmaster shook his head in doubt as he answered: “You’ll see how the plan of which they talked to me meets the same fate as mine has. But yet, let us see!”\n [1] The common crowd is a fool and since it pays for it, it is proper to talk to it foolishly to please it.\n[2] “The schools are under the inspection of the parish priests. Reading and writing in Spanish are taught, or at least it is so ordered; but the schoolmaster himself usually does not know it, and on the other hand the Spanish government employees do not understand the vernacular. Besides, the curates, in order to preserve their influence intact, do not look favorably upon the spread of Castilian. About the only ones who know Spanish are the Indians who have been in the service of Europeans. The first reading exercise is some devotional book, then the catechism; the reader is called Casaysayan. On the average half of the children between seven and ten years attend school; they learn to read fairly well and some to write a little, but they soon forget it.”—Jagor, Viajes por Filipinas (Vidal’s Spanish version). Jagor was speaking particularly of the settled parts of the Bicol region. Referring to the islands generally, his “half of the children” would be a great exaggeration.—TR.\n[3] A delicate bit of sarcasm is lost in the translation here. The reference to Maestro Ciruela in Spanish is somewhat similar to a mention in English of Mr. Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall fame.—TR.\n[4] By one of the provisions of a royal decree of December 20, 1863, the Catecismo de la Doctrina Cristina, by Gaspar Astete, was prescribed as the text-book for primary schools, in the Philippines. See Blair and Robertson’s The Philippine Islands, Vol. XLVI, p. 98; Census of the Philippine Islands (Washington, 1905), p. 584.—TR.\n Chapter XX The Meeting in the Town Hall The hall was about twelve to fifteen meters long by eight to ten wide. Its whitewashed walls were covered with drawings in charcoal, more or less ugly and obscene, with inscriptions to complete their meanings. Stacked neatly against the wall in one corner were to be seen about a dozen old flint-locks among rusty swords and talibons, the armament of the cuadrilleros.1 At one end of the hall there hung, half hidden by soiled red curtains, a picture of his Majesty, the King of Spain. Underneath this picture, upon a wooden platform, an old chair spread out its broken arms. In front of the chair was a wooden table spotted with ink stains and whittled and carved with inscriptions and initials like the tables in the German taverns frequented by students. Benches and broken chairs completed the furniture.\nThis is the hall of council, of judgment, and of torture, wherein are now gathered the officials of the town and its dependent villages. The faction of old men does not mix with that of the youths, for they are mutually hostile. They represent respectively the conservative and the liberal parties, save that their disputes assume in the towns an extreme character.\n“The conduct of the gobernadorcillo fills me with distrust,” Don Filipo, the teniente-mayor and leader of the liberal faction, was saying to his friends. “It was a deep-laid scheme, this thing of putting off the discussion of expenses until the eleventh hour. Remember that we have scarcely eleven days left.”\n“And he has staved at the convento to hold a conference with the curate, who is sick,” observed one of the youths.\n“It doesn’t matter,” remarked another. “We have everything prepared. Just so the plan of the old men doesn’t receive a majority—”\n“I don’t believe it will,” interrupted Don Filipo, “as I shall present the plan of the old men myself!”\n“What! What are you saying?” asked his surprised hearers.\n“I said that if I speak first I shall present the plan of our rivals.”\n“But what about our plan?”\n“I shall leave it to you to present ours,” answered Don Filipo with a smile, turning toward a youthful cabeza de barangay.[2] “You will propose it after I have been defeated.”\n“We don’t understand you, sir,” said his hearers, staring at him with doubtful looks.\n“Listen,” continued the liberal leader in a low voice to several near him. “This morning I met old Tasio and the old man said to me: ‘Your rivals hate you more than they do your ideas. Do you wish that a thing shall not be done? Then propose it yourself, and though it were more useful than a miter, it would be rejected. Once they have defeated you, have the least forward person in the whole gathering propose what you want, and your rivals, in order to humiliate you, will accept it.’ But keep quiet about it.”\n“But—”\n“So I will propose the plan of our rivals and exaggerate it to the point of making it ridiculous. Ah, here come Señor Ibarra and the schoolmaster.”\nThese two young men saluted each of the groups without joining either. A few moments later the gobernadorcillo, the very same individual whom we saw yesterday carrying a bundle of candles, entered with a look of disgust on his face. Upon his entrance the murmurs ceased, every one sat down, and silence was gradually established, as he took his seat under the picture of the King, coughed four or five times, rubbed his hand over his face and head, rested his elbows on the table, then withdrew them, coughed once more, and then the whole thing over again.\n“Gentlemen,” he at last began in an unsteady voice, “I have been so bold as to call you together here for this meeting—ahem! Ahem! We have to celebrate the fiesta of our patron saint, San Diego, on the twelfth of this month—ahem!—today is the second—ahem! Ahem!” At this point a slow, dry cough cut off his speech.\nA man of proud bearing, apparently about forty years of age, then arose from the bench of the elders. He was the rich Capitan Basilio, the direct contrast of Don Rafael, Ibarra’s father. He was a man who maintained that after the death of St. Thomas Aquinas the world had made no more progress, and that since St. John Lateran had left it, humanity had been retrograding.\n“Gentlemen, allow me to speak a few words about such an interesting matter,” he began. “I speak first even though there are others here present who have more right to do so than I have, but I speak first because in these matters it seems to me that by speaking first one does not take the first place—no more than that by speaking last does one become the least. Besides, the things that I have to say are of such importance that they should not be put off or last spoken of, and accordingly I wish to speak first in order to give them due weight. So you will allow me to speak first in this meeting where I see so many notable persons, such as the present señor capitan, the former capitan; my distinguished friend, Don Valentin, a former capitan; the friend of my infancy, Don Julio; our celebrated captain of cuadrilleros, Don Melchor; and many other personages, whom, for the sake of brevity, I must omit to enumerate—all of whom you see present here. I beg of you that I may be allowed a few words before any one else speaks. Have I the good fortune to see my humble request granted by the meeting?”\nHere the orator with a faint smile inclined his head respectfully. “Go on, you have our undivided attention!” said the notables alluded to and some others who considered Capitan Basilio a great orator. The elders coughed in a satisfied way and rubbed their hands. After wiping the perspiration from his brow with a silk handkerchief, he then proceeded:\n“Now that you have been so kind and complaisant with my humble self as to grant me the use of a few words before any one else of those here present, I shall take advantage of this permission, so generously granted, and shall talk. In imagination I fancy myself in the midst of the august Roman senate, senatus populusque romanus, as was said in those happy days which, unfortunately for humanity, will nevermore return. I propose to the Patres Conscripti, as the learned Cicero would say if he were in my place, I propose, in view of the short time left, and time is money as Solomon said, that concerning this important matter each one set forth his opinion clearly, briefly, and simply.”\nSatisfied with himself and flattered by the attention in the hall, the orator took his seat, not without first casting a glance of superiority toward Ibarra, who was seated in a corner, and a significant look at his friends as if to say, “Aha! Haven’t I spoken well?” His friends reflected both of these expressions by staring at the youths as though to make them die of envy.\n“Now any one may speak who wishes that—ahem!” began the gobernadorcillo, but a repetition of the cough and sighs cut short the phrase.\nTo judge from the silence, no one wished to consider himself called upon as one of the Conscript Fathers, since no one rose. Then Don Filipo seized the opportunity and rose to speak. The conservatives winked and made significant signs to each other.\n“I rise, gentlemen, to present my estimate of expenses for the fiesta,” he began. “We can’t allow it,” commented a consumptive old man, who was an irreconcilable conservative.\n“We’ll vote against it,” corroborated others. “Gentlemen!” exclaimed Don Filipo, repressing a smile, “I haven’t yet made known the plan which we, the younger men, bring here. We feel sure that this great plan will be preferred by all over any other that our opponents think of or are capable of conceiving.”\nThis presumptuous exordium so thoroughly irritated the minds of the conservatives that they swore in their hearts to offer determined opposition.\n“We have estimated three thousand five hundred pesos for the expenses,” went on Don Filipo. “Now then, with such a sum we shall be able to celebrate a fiesta that will eclipse in magnificence any that has been seen up to this time in our own or neighboring provinces.”\n“Ahem!” coughed some doubters. “The town of A——— has five thousand, B——— has four thousand, ahem! Humbug!”\n“Listen to me, gentlemen, and I’ll convince you,” continued the unterrified speaker. “I propose that we erect a theater in the middle of the plaza, to cost one hundred and fifty pesos.”\n“That won’t be enough! It’ll take one hundred and sixty,” objected a confirmed conservative.\n“Write it down, Señor Director, two hundred pesos for the theater,” said Don Filipo. “I further propose that we contract with a troupe of comedians from Tondo for seven performances on seven successive nights. Seven performances at two hundred pesos a night make fourteen hundred pesos. Write down fourteen hundred pesos, Señor Director!”\nBoth the elders and the youths stared in amazement. Only those in the secret gave no sign.\n“I propose besides that we have magnificent fireworks; no little lights and pin-wheels such as please children and old maids, nothing of the sort. We want big bombs and immense rockets. I propose two hundred big bombs at two pesos each and two hundred rockets at the same price. We’ll have them made by the pyrotechnists of Malabon.”\n“Huh!” grunted an old man, “a two-peso bomb doesn’t frighten or deafen me! They ought to be three-peso ones.”\n“Write down one thousand pesos for two hundred bombs and two hundred rockets.”\nThe conservatives could no longer restrain themselves. Some of them rose and began to whisper together. “Moreover, in order that our visitors may see that we are a liberal people and have plenty of money,” continued the speaker, raising his voice and casting a rapid glance at the whispering group of elders, “I propose: first, four hermanos mayores[3] for the two days of the fiesta; and second, that each day there be thrown into the lake two hundred fried chickens, one hundred stuffed capons, and forty roast pigs, as did Sylla, a contemporary of that Cicero, of whom Capitan Basilio just spoke.”\n“That’s it, like Sylla,” repeated the flattered Capitan Basilio.\nThe surprise steadily increased.\n“Since many rich people will attend and each one will bring thousands of pesos, his best game-cocks, and his playing-cards, I propose that the cockpit run for fifteen days and that license be granted to open all gambling houses—”\nThe youths interrupted him by rising, thinking that he had gone crazy. The elders were arguing heatedly.\n“And, finally, that we may not neglect the pleasures of the soul—”\nThe murmurs and cries which arose all over the hall drowned his voice out completely, and tumult reigned.\n“No!” yelled an irreconcilable conservative. “I don’t want him to flatter himself over having run the whole fiesta, no! Let me speak! Let me speak!”\n“Don Filipo has deceived us,” cried the liberals. “We’ll vote against his plan. He has gone over to the old men. We’ll vote against him!”\nThe gobernadorcillo, more overwhelmed than ever, did nothing to restore order, but rather was waiting for them to restore it themselves.\nThe captain of the cuadrilleros begged to be heard and was granted permission to speak, but he did not open his mouth and sat down again confused and ashamed.\nBy good fortune, Capitan Valentin, the most moderate of all the conservatives, arose and said: “We cannot agree to what the teniente-mayor has proposed, as it appears to be exaggerated. So many bombs and so many nights of theatrical performances can only be desired by a young man, such as he is, who can spend night after night sitting up and listening to so many explosions without becoming deaf. I have consulted the opinion of the sensible persons here and all of them unanimously disapprove Don Filipo’s plan. Is it not so, gentlemen?”\n“Yes, yes!” cried the youths and elders with one voice. The youths were delighted to hear an old man speak so.\n“What are we going to do with four hermanos mayores?” went on the old man. “What is the meaning of those chickens, capons, and roast pigs, thrown into the lake? ‘Humbug!’ our neighbors would say. And afterwards we should have to fast for six months! What have we to do with Sylla and the Romans? Have they ever invited us to any of their festivities, I wonder? I, at least, have never received any invitation from them, and you can all see that I’m an old man!”\n“The Romans live in Rome, where the Pope is,” Capitan Basilio prompted him in a low voice. “Now I understand!” exclaimed the old man calmly.\n“They would make of their festivals watch-meetings, and the Pope would order them to throw their food into the sea so that they might commit no sin. But, in spite of all that, your plan is inadmissible, impossible, a piece of foolishness!”\nBeing so stoutly opposed, Don Filipo had to withdraw his proposal. Now that their chief rival had been defeated, even the worst of the irreconcilable insurgents looked on with calmness while a young cabeza de barangay asked for the floor.\n“I beg that you excuse the boldness of one so young as I am in daring to speak before so many persons respected for their age and prudence and judgment in affairs, but since the eloquent orator, Capitan Basilio, has requested every one to express his opinion, let the authoritative words spoken by him excuse my insignificance.”\nThe conservatives nodded their heads with satisfaction, remarking to one another: “This young man talks sensibly.” “He’s modest.” “He reasons admirably.”\n“What a pity that he doesn’t know very well how to gesticulate,” observed Capitan Basilio. “But there’s time yet! He hasn’t studied Cicero and he’s still a young man!”\n“If I present to you, gentlemen, any program or plan,” the young man continued, “I don’t do so with the thought that you will find it perfect or that you will accept it, but at the same time that I once more bow to the judgment of all of you, I wish to prove to our elders that our thoughts are always like theirs, since we take as our own those ideas so eloquently expressed by Capitan Basilio.”\n“Well spoken! Well spoken!” cried the flattered conservatives. Capitan Basilio made signs to the speaker showing him how he should stand and how he ought to move his arm. The only one remaining impassive was the gobernadorcillo, who was either bewildered or preoccupied; as a matter of fact, he seemed to be both. The young man went on with more warmth:\n“My plan, gentlemen, reduces itself to this: invent new shows that are not common and ordinary, such as we see every day, and endeavor that the money collected may not leave the town, and that it be not wasted in smoke, but that it be used in some manner beneficial to all.”\n“That’s right!” assented the youths. “That’s what we want.”\n“Excellent!” added the elders.\n“What should we get from a week of comedies, as the teniente-mayor proposes? What can we learn from the kings of Bohemia and Granada, who commanded that their daughters’ heads be cut off, or that they should be blown from a cannon, which later is converted into a throne? We are not kings, neither are we barbarians; we have no cannon, and if we should imitate those people, they would hang us on Bagumbayan. What are those princesses who mingle in the battles, scattering thrusts and blows about in combat with princes, or who wander alone over mountains and through valleys as though seduced by the tikbálang? Our nature is to love sweetness and tenderness in woman, and we would shudder at the thought of taking the blood-stained hand of a maiden, even when the blood was that of a Moro or a giant, so abhorred by us. We consider vile the man who raises his hand against a woman, be he prince or alferez or rude countryman. Would it not be a thousand times better to give a representation of our own customs in order to correct our defects and vices and to encourage our better qualities?”\n“That’s right! That’s right!” exclaimed some of his faction.\n“He’s right,” muttered several old men thoughtfully.\n“I should never have thought of that,” murmured Capitan Basilio.\n“But how are you going to do it?” asked the irreconcilable.\n“Very easily,” answered the youth. “I have brought here two dramas which I feel sure the good taste and recognized judgment of the respected elders here assembled will find very agreeable and entertaining. One is entitled ‘The Election of the Gobernadorcillo,’ being a comedy in prose in five acts, written by one who is here present. The other is in nine acts for two nights and is a fantastical drama of a satirical nature, entitled ‘Mariang Makiling,’4 written by one of the best poets of the province. Seeing that the discussion of preparations for the fiesta has been postponed and fearing that there would not be time enough left, we have secretly secured the actors and had them learn their parts. We hope that with a week of rehearsal they will have plenty of time to know their parts thoroughly. This, gentlemen, besides being new, useful, and reasonable, has the great advantage of being economical; we shall not need costumes, as those of our daily life will be suitable.”\n“I’ll pay for the theater!” shouted Capitan Basilio enthusiastically.\n“If you need cuadrilleros, I’ll lend you mine,” cried their captain.\n“And I—and I—if art old man is needed—” stammered another one, swelling with pride.\n“Accepted! Accepted!” cried many voices.\nDon Filipo became pale with emotion and his eyes filled with tears.\n“He’s crying from spite,” thought the irreconcilable, so he yelled, “Accepted! Accepted without discussion!” Thus satisfied with revenge and the complete defeat of his rival, this fellow began to praise the young man’s plan.\nThe latter continued his speech: “A fifth of the money collected may be used to distribute a few prizes, such as to the best school child, the best herdsman, farmer, fisherman, and so on. We can arrange for boat races on the river and lake and for horse races on shore, we can raise greased poles and also have other games in which our country people can take part. I concede that on account of our long-established customs we must have some fireworks; wheels and fire castles are very beautiful and entertaining, but I don’t believe it necessary to have bombs, as the former speaker proposed. Two bands of music will afford sufficient merriment and thus we shall avoid those rivalries and quarrels between the poor musicians who come to gladden our fiesta with their work and who so often behave like fighting-cocks, afterwards going away poorly paid, underfed, and even bruised and wounded at times. With the money left over we can begin the erection of a small building for a schoolhouse, since we can’t wait until God Himself comes down and builds one for us, and it is a sad state of affairs that while we have a fine cockpit our children study almost in the curate’s stable. Such are the outlines of my plan; the details can be worked out by all.”\nA murmur of pleasure ran through the hall, as nearly every one agreed with the youth.\nSome few muttered, “Innovations! Innovations! When we were young—”\n“Let’s adopt it for the time being and humiliate that fellow,” said others, indicating Don Filipo.\nWhen silence was restored all were agreed. There was lacking only the approval of the gobernadorcillo. That worthy official was perspiring and fidgeting about. He rubbed his hand over his forehead and was at length able to stammer out in a weak voice: “I also agree, but—ahem!”\nEvery one in the hall listened in silence.\n“But what?” asked Capitan Basilio.\n“Very agreeable,” repeated the gobernadorcillo, “that is to say—I don’t agree—I mean—yes, but—” Here he rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand. “But the curate,” the poor fellow went on, “the curate wants something else.”\n“Does the curate or do we ourselves pay for this fiesta? Has he given a cuarto for it?” exclaimed a penetrating voice. All looked toward the place whence these questions came and saw there the Sage Tasio.\nDon Filipo remained motionless with his eyes fixed on the gobernadorcillo.\n“What does the curate want?” asked Capitan Basilio.\n“Well, the padre wants six processions, three sermons, three high masses, and if there is any money left, a comedy from Tondo with songs in the intermissions.”\n“But we don’t want that,” said the youths and some of the old men.\n“The curate wants it,” repeated the gobernadorcillo. “I’ve promised him that his wish shall be carried out.”\n“Then why did you have us assemble here?”\n“F-for the very purpose of telling you this!”\n“Why didn’t you tell us so at the start?”\n“I wanted to tell you, gentlemen, but Capitan Basilio spoke and I haven’t had a chance. The curate must be obeyed.”\n“He must be obeyed,” echoed several old men.\n“He must be obeyed or else the alcalde will put us all in jail,” added several other old men sadly.\n“Well then, obey him, and run the fiesta yourselves,” exclaimed the youths, rising. “We withdraw our contributions.”\n“Everything has already been collected,” said the gobernadorcillo.\nDon Filipo approached this official and said to him bitterly, “I sacrificed my pride in favor of a good cause; you are sacrificing your dignity as a man in favor of a bad one, and you’ve spoiled everything.”\nIbarra turned to the schoolmaster and asked him, “Is there anything that I can do for you at the capital of the province? I leave for there immediately.”\n“Have you some business there?”\n“We have business there!” answered Ibarra mysteriously.\nOn the way home, when Don Filipo was cursing his bad luck, old Tasio said to him: “The blame is ours! You didn’t protest when they gave you a slave for a chief, and I, fool that I am, had forgotten it!”\n 1 The municipal police of the old régime. They were thus described by a Spanish writer, W. E. Retana, in a note to Ventura F. Lopez’s El Filibustero (Madrid, 1893): “Municipal guards, whose duties are principally rural. Their uniform is a disaster; they go barefoot; on horseback, they hold the reins in the right hand and a lance in the left. They are usually good-for-nothing, but to their credit it must be said that they do no damage. Lacking military instruction, provided with fire-arms of the first part of the century, of which one in a hundred might go off in case of need, and for other arms bolos, talibons, old swords, etc., the cuadrilleros are truly a parody on armed force.”—TR.\n2 Headman and tax-collector of a district, generally including about fifty families, for whose annual tribute he was personally responsible. The “barangay” is a Malay boat of the kind supposed to have been used by the first emigrants to the Philippines. Hence, at first, the “head of a barangay” meant the leader or chief of a family or group of families. This office, quite analogous to the old Germanic or Anglo-Saxon “head of a hundred,” was adopted and perpetuated by the Spaniards in their system of local administration.—TR.\n3 The hermano mayor was a person appointed to direct the ceremonies during the fiesta, an appointment carrying with it great honor and importance, but also entailing considerable expense, as the appointee was supposed to furnish a large share of the entertainments. Hence, the greater the number of hermanos mayores the more splendid the fiesta,—TR.\n4 Mt. Makiling is a volcanic cone at the southern end of the Lake of Bay. At its base is situated the town of Kalamba, the author’s birthplace. About this mountain cluster a number of native legends having as their principal character a celebrated sorceress or enchantress, known as “Mariang Makiling.”—TR.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal-complete/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tangere by Jose Rizal"},{"body":"Translated into English from the original Spanish\nPublished by Philippine Education Company\nNew York: World Book Company\n1912\nCopyright, 1912, by Philippine Education Company.\nEntered at Stationers’ Hall.\nRegistrado en las Islas Filipinas.\nAll rights reserved.\n","categories":"","description":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","excerpt":"Complete English translation by Charles Derbyshire","ref":"/wiki/noli-me-tangere-jose-rizal/","tags":"","title":"Noli Me Tángere by José Rizal"},{"body":"Pia Ranada-Robles is a journalist and a Rappler reporter assigned in the Malacañang Press.

He is tagged as the national hero of the Filipino people. An ophthalmologist by profession, Rizal became a writer and a key member of the Filipino Propaganda Movement, which advocated political reforms for the colony under Spain.\n\u003cimg src=“featured-jose-rizal.jpg” alt=“Girl in a jacket” style=”float: left; padding: 0 15px 15px 0;”\u003e\nHe was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine Revolution, inspired in part by his writings, broke out. Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct, he ultimately approved of its goals which eventually led to Philippine independence.\nHe is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines and has been recommended to be so honored by an officially empaneled National Heroes Committee. However, no law, executive order or proclamation has been enacted or issued officially proclaiming any Filipino historical figure as a national hero. He was the author of the novels Noli Me Tángere and El filibusterismo, and a number of poems and essays.\nEarly life José Rizal was born in 1861 to Francisco Rizal Mercado y Alejandro and Teodora Alonso Realonda y Quintos in the town of Calamba in Laguna province. He had nine sisters and one brother. His parents were leaseholders of a hacienda and an accompanying rice farm by the Dominicans. Both their families had adopted the additional surnames of Rizal and Realonda in 1849, after Governor General Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa decreed the adoption of Spanish surnames among the Filipinos for census purposes (though they already had Spanish names).\nLike many families in the Philippines, the Rizals were of mixed mestizo origin. José’s patrilineal lineage could be traced back to Fujian in China through his father’s ancestor Lam-Co, a Hokkien Chinese merchant who immigrated to the Philippines in the late 17th century. Lam-Co traveled to Manila from Xiamen, China, possibly to avoid the famine or plague in his home district, and more probably to escape the Manchu invasion during the Transition from Ming to Qing. He finally decided to stay in the islands as a farmer. In 1697, to escape the bitter anti-Chinese prejudice that existed in the Philippines, he converted to Catholicism, changed his name to Domingo Mercado and married the daughter of Chinese friend Augustin Chin-co. On his mother’s side, Rizal’s ancestry included Chinese, Japanese and Tagalog blood. His mother’s lineage can be traced to the affluent Florentina family of Chinese mestizo families originating in Baliuag, Bulacan. He also had Spanish ancestry. Regina Ochoa, a grandmother of his mother, Teodora, had mixed Spanish, Chinese and Tagalog blood. His grandfather was a half Spaniard engineer named Lorenzo Alberto Alonzo.\nFrom an early age, José showed a precocious intellect. He learned the alphabet from his mother at 3, and could read and write at age 5. Upon enrolling at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, he dropped the last three names that made up his full name, on the advice of his brother, Paciano and the Mercado family, thus rendering his name as “José Protasio Rizal”. Of this, he later wrote: “My family never paid much attention [to our second surname Rizal], but now I had to use it, thus giving me the appearance of an illegitimate child!” This was to enable him to travel freely and disassociate him from his brother, who had gained notoriety with his earlier links to Filipino priests Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora (popularly known as Gomburza) who had been accused and executed for treason.\nDespite the name change, José, as “Rizal”, soon distinguished himself in poetry writing contests, impressing his professors with his facility with Castilian and other foreign languages, and later, in writing essays that were critical of the Spanish historical accounts of the pre-colonial Philippine societies. Indeed, by 1891, the year he finished his El filibusterismo, this second surname had become so well known that, as he writes to another friend, “All my family now carry the name Rizal instead of Mercado because the name Rizal means persecution! Good! I too want to join them and be worthy of this family name…”\nEducation Rizal first studied under Justiniano Aquino Cruz in Biñan, Laguna, before he was sent to Manila. As to his father’s request, he took the entrance examination in Colegio de San Juan de Letran but he then enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and graduated as one of the nine students in his class declared sobresaliente or outstanding. He continued his education at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila to obtain a land surveyor and assessor’s degree, and at the same time at the University of Santo Tomas where he did take up a preparatory course in law and finished with a mark of excelente or excellent. He finished the course of Philosophy as a pre-law. Upon learning that his mother was going blind, he decided to switch to medicine at the medical school of Santo Tomas specializing later in ophthalmology. He received his four-year practical training in medicine at Ospital de San Juan de Dios in Intramuros. In his last year at medical school, he received a mark of sobresaliente in courses of Patologia Medica (Medical Pathology), Patología Quirúrgica (Surgical Pathology) and Obstretics.\nRizal, known for being an intelligent student, had some difficulty in some subjects in medical school such as Física (Physics) and Patología General (General Pathology). One of the causes is due to the evident discrimination of the Profesor to Filipino students.\nWithout his parents' knowledge and consent, but secretly supported by his brother Paciano, he traveled alone to Madrid in May 1882 and studied medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid where he earned the degree, Licentiate in Medicine. He also attended medical lectures at the University of Paris and the University of Heidelberg. In Berlin, he was inducted as a member of the Berlin Ethnological Society and the Berlin Anthropological Society under the patronage of the famous pathologist Rudolf Virchow. Following custom, he delivered an address in German in April 1887 before the Anthropological Society on the orthography and structure of the Tagalog language. He left Heidelberg a poem, “A las flores del Heidelberg”, which was both an evocation and a prayer for the welfare of his native land and the unification of common values between East and West.\nAt Heidelberg, the 25-year-old Rizal completed in 1887 his eye specialization under the renowned professor, Otto Becker. There he used the newly invented ophthalmoscope (invented by Hermann von Helmholtz) to later operate on his own mother’s eye. From Heidelberg, Rizal wrote his parents: “I spend half of the day in the study of German and the other half, in the diseases of the eye. Twice a week, I go to the bierbrauerie, or beerhall, to speak German with my student friends.” He lived in a Karlstraße boarding house then moved to Ludwigsplatz. There, he met Reverend Karl Ullmer and stayed with them in Wilhelmsfeld, where he wrote the last few chapters of Noli Me Tángere.\nRizal was a polymath, skilled in both science and the arts. He painted, sketched, and made sculptures and woodcarving. He was a prolific poet, essayist, and novelist whose most famous works were his two novels, Noli Me Tángere and its sequel, El filibusterismo. These social commentaries during the Spanish colonization of the country formed the nucleus of literature that inspired peaceful reformists and armed revolutionaries alike. Rizal was also a polyglot, conversant in twenty-two languages.\nRizal’s multifacetedness was described by his German friend, Dr. Adolf Bernhard Meyer, as “stupendous.” Documented studies show him to be a polymath with the ability to master various skills and subjects. He was an ophthalmologist, sculptor, painter, educator, farmer, historian, playwright and journalist. Besides poetry and creative writing, he dabbled, with varying degrees of expertise, in architecture, cartography, economics, ethnology, anthropology, sociology, dramatics, martial arts, fencing and pistol shooting. He was also a Freemason, joining Acacia Lodge No. 9 during his time in Spain and becoming a Master Mason in 1884.\nPersonal life and relationships José Rizal’s life is one of the most documented of 19th century Filipinos due to the vast and extensive records written by and about him. Almost everything in his short life is recorded somewhere, being himself a regular diarist and prolific letter writer, much of the material having survived. His biographers, however, have faced difficulty in translating his writings because of Rizal’s habit of switching from one language to another.\nThey drew largely from his travel diaries with their insights of a young Asian encountering the West for the first time. They included his later trips, home and back again to Europe through Japan and the United States, and, finally, through his self-imposed exile in Hong Kong.\nShortly after he graduated from the Ateneo Municipal de Manila (now Ateneo de Manila University), Rizal (who was then 16 years old) and a friend, Mariano Katigbak, came to visit Rizal’s maternal grandmother in Tondo, Manila. Mariano brought along his sister, Segunda Katigbak, a 14-year-old Batangueña from Lipa, Batangas. It was the first time they met and Rizal described Segunda as “rather short, with eyes that were eloquent and ardent at times and languid at others, rosy–cheeked, with an enchanting and provocative smile that revealed very beautiful teeth, and the air of a sylph; her entire self diffused a mysterious charm.” His grandmother’s guests were mostly college students and they knew that Rizal had skills in painting. They suggested that Rizal should make a portrait of Segunda. He complied reluctantly and made a pencil sketch of her. Unfortunately for Rizal who had referred to her as his first love in his memoir Memorias de un Estudiante de Manila, Katigbak was already engaged to Manuel Luz.\nFrom December 1891 to June 1892, Rizal lived with his family in Number 2 of Rednaxela Terrace, Mid-levels, Hong Kong Island. Rizal used 5 D’Aguilar Street, Central district, Hong Kong Island, as his ophthalmology clinic from 2 pm to 6 pm. This period of his life included his recorded affections of which nine were identified. They were Gertrude Beckett of Chalcot Crescent, Primrose Hill, Camden, London, wealthy and high-minded Nelly Boustead of the English and Iberian merchant family, last descendant of a noble Japanese family Seiko Usui (affectionately called O-Sei-san), his earlier friendship with Segunda Katigbak, Leonor Valenzuela, and eight-year romantic relationship with a distant cousin, Leonor Rivera (popularly thought to be the inspiration for the character of María Clara in Noli me tangere).\nAffair In one recorded account detailing Rizal’s 1887 visit to Prague, Maximo Viola wrote that Rizal succumbed to the temptation of a ‘lady of the camellias’. Viola, a friend of Rizal’s and an early financier of Noli Me Tangere, was alluding to Dumas’s 1848 novel, La dame aux camelias, about a man who fell in love with a courtesan. While the affair was on record, there were no further details in Viola’s letter concerning the duration and nature of the affair.\nAssociation with Leonor Rivera Leonor Rivera is thought to be the inspiration for the character of María Clara in Noli Me Tángere and El Filibusterismo. Rivera and Rizal first met in Manila when Rivera was only 14 years old. When Rizal left for Europe on May 3, 1882, Rivera was 16 years of age. Their correspondence began when Rizal left a poem for Rivera saying farewell.\nThe correspondence between Rivera and Rizal kept him focused on his studies in Europe. They employed codes in their letters because Rivera’s mother did not favor Rizal. A letter from Mariano Katigbak dated June 27, 1884, referred to Rivera as Rizal’s “betrothed”. Katigbak described Rivera as having been greatly affected by Rizal’s departure, frequently sick because of insomnia.\nWhen Rizal returned to the Philippines on August 5, 1887, Rivera and her family had moved back to Dagupan, Pangasinan. Rizal was forbidden by his father Francisco Mercado to see Rivera in order to avoid putting the Rivera family in danger because at the time Rizal was already labeled by the criollo elite as a filibustero or subversive because of his novel Noli Me Tángere. Rizal wanted to marry Rivera while he was still in the Philippines because of Rivera’s uncomplaining fidelity. Rizal asked permission from his father one more time before his second departure from the Philippines. The meeting never happened. In 1888, Rizal stopped receiving letters from Rivera for a year, although Rizal kept sending letters to Rivera. The reason for Rivera’s year of silence was the connivance between Rivera’s mother and the Englishman named Henry Kipping, a railway engineer who fell in love with Rivera and was favored by Rivera’s mother. The news of Leonor Rivera’s marriage to Kipping devastated Rizal.\nHis European friends kept almost everything he gave them, including doodlings on pieces of paper. In the home of a Spanish liberal, Pedro Ortiga y Pérez, he left an impression that was to be remembered by his daughter, Consuelo. In her diary, she wrote of a day Rizal spent there and regaled them with his wit, social graces, and sleight-of-hand tricks. In London, during his research on Antonio de Morga’s writings, he became a regular guest in the home of Reinhold Rost of the British Museum who referred to him as “a gem of a man.” The family of Karl Ullmer, pastor of Wilhelmsfeld, and the Blumentritts saved even buttonholes and napkins with sketches and notes. They were ultimately bequeathed to the Rizal family to form a treasure trove of memorabilia. Josephine Bracken was Rizal’s common-law wife whom he reportedly married shortly before his execution.\nRelationship with Josephine Bracken In February 1895, Rizal, 33, met Josephine Bracken, an Irish woman from Hong Kong, when she accompanied her blind adoptive father, George Taufer, to have his eyes checked by Rizal. After frequent visits, Rizal and Bracken fell in love with each other. They applied to marry but, because of Rizal’s reputation from his writings and political stance, the local priest Father Obach would only hold the ceremony if Rizal could get permission from the Bishop of Cebu. He was unable to obtain an ecclesiastical marriage because he would not return to Catholicism.\nAfter accompanying her father to Manila on her return to Hong Kong, and before heading back to Dapitan to live with Rizal, Josephine introduced herself to members of Rizal’s family in Manila. His mother suggested a civil marriage, which she believed to be a lesser sacrament but less sinful to Rizal’s conscience than making any sort of political retraction in order to gain permission from the Bishop. Rizal and Josephine lived as husband and wife in a common-law marriage in Talisay in Dapitan. The couple had a son who lived only for a few hours; Rizal named him after his father Francisco.\nIn Brussels and Spain (1890–92) In 1890, Rizal, 29, left Paris for Brussels as he was preparing for the publication of his annotations of Antonio de Morga’s Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas (1609). He lived in the boarding house of the two Jacoby sisters, Catherina and Suzanna, who had a niece Suzanna (“Thil”), age 16. Historian Gregorio F. Zaide states that Rizal had “his romance with Suzanne Jacoby, 45, the petite niece of his landladies.” Belgian Pros Slachmuylders, however, believed that Rizal had a romance with the 17-year-old niece, Suzanna Thil, as his other liaisons were all with young women. He found records clarifying their names and ages.\nRizal’s Brussels stay was short-lived; he moved to Madrid, giving the young Suzanna a box of chocolates. She wrote to him in French: “After your departure, I did not take the chocolate. The box is still intact as on the day of your parting. Don’t delay too long writing us because I wear out the soles of my shoes for running to the mailbox to see if there is a letter from you. There will never be any home in which you are so loved as in that in Brussels, so, you little bad boy, hurry up and come back…” In 2007, Slachmuylders' group arranged for an historical marker honoring Rizal to be placed at the house.\nHe published Dimanche des Rameaux (Palm Sunday), a socio-political essay, in Berlin on 30 November 1886. He discussed the significance of Palm Sunday in socio-political terms: “This entry [of Jesus into Jerusalem] decided the fate of the jealous priests, the Pharisees, of all those who believed themselves the only ones who had the right to speak in the name of God, of those who would not admit the truths said by others because they have not been said by them. That triumph, those hosannas, all those flowers, those olive branches, were not for Jesus alone; they were the songs of the victory of the new law, they were the canticles celebrating the dignification of man, the liberty of man, the first mortal blow directed against despotism and slavery”. Shortly its publication, Rizal was summoned by the German police who suspected him of being a French spy.\nThe content of Rizal’s writings changed considerably in his two most famous novels, Noli Me Tángere, published in Berlin in 1887, and El Filibusterismo, published in Ghent in 1891. For the latter, he used funds borrowed from his friends. These writings angered both the Spanish colonial elite and many educated Filipinos due to their symbolism. They are critical of Spanish friars and the power of the Church. Rizal’s friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, an Austria-Hungary-born professor and historian, wrote that the novel’s characters were drawn from real life and that every episode can be repeated on any day in the Philippines.\nBlumentritt was the grandson of the Imperial Treasurer at Vienna in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and a staunch defender of the Catholic faith. This did not dissuade him from writing the preface of El filibusterismo after he had translated Noli Me Tángere into German. As Blumentritt had warned, these books resulted in Rizal’s being prosecuted as the inciter of revolution. He was eventually tried by the military, convicted and executed. Teaching the natives where they stood brought about an adverse reaction, as the Philippine Revolution of 1896 took off virulently thereafter. Leaders of the reform movement in Spain. Left to right: Rizal, del Pilar, and Ponce (c. 1890).\nAs leader of the reform movement of Filipino students in Spain, Rizal contributed essays, allegories, poems, and editorials to the Spanish newspaper La Solidaridad in Barcelona (in this case Rizal used a pen name, “Dimasalang”, “Laong Laan” and “May Pagasa”). The core of his writings centers on liberal and progressive ideas of individual rights and freedom; specifically, rights for the Filipino people. He shared the same sentiments with members of the movement: that the Philippines is battling, in Rizal’s own words, “a double-faced Goliath”—corrupt friars and bad government. His commentaries reiterate the following agenda:\n That the Philippines be made a province of Spain (The Philippines was a province of New Spain – now Mexico, administered from Mexico city from 1565 to 1821. From 1821 to 1898 it was administered directly from Spain.) Representation in the Cortes Filipino priests instead of Spanish friars – Augustinians, Dominicans, and Franciscans – in parishes and remote sitios Freedom of assembly and speech Equal rights before the law (for both Filipino and Spanish plaintiffs)  The colonial authorities in the Philippines did not favor these reforms. Such Spanish intellectuals as Morayta, Unamuno, Pi y Margall, and others did endorse them.\nWenceslao Retana, a political commentator in Spain, had slighted Rizal by writing an insulting article in La Epoca, a newspaper in Madrid. He implied that the family and friends of Rizal were evicted from their lands in Calamba for not having paid their due rents. The incident (when Rizal was ten) stemmed from an accusation that Rizal’s mother, Teodora, tried to poison the wife of a cousin, but she said she was trying to help. With the approval of the Church prelates, and without a hearing, she was ordered to prison in Santa Cruz in 1871. She was made to walk the ten miles (16 km) from Calamba. She was released after two-and-a-half years of appeals to the highest court. In 1887, Rizal wrote a petition on behalf of the tenants of Calamba, and later that year led them to speak out against the friars' attempts to raise rent. They initiated a litigation which resulted in the Dominicans' evicting them from their homes, including the Rizal family. General Valeriano Weyler had the buildings on the farm torn down.\nUpon reading the article, Rizal sent a representative to challenge Retana to a duel. Retana published a public apology and later became one of Rizal’s biggest admirers, writing Rizal’s most important biography, Vida y Escritos del José Rizal.\nReturn to Philippines (1892–96) Exile in Dapitan Upon his return to Manila in 1892, he formed a civic movement called La Liga Filipina. The league advocated these moderate social reforms through legal means, but was disbanded by the governor. At that time, he had already been declared an enemy of the state by the Spanish authorities because of the publication of his novel.\nRizal was implicated in the activities of the nascent rebellion and in July 1892, was deported to Dapitan in the province of Zamboanga, a peninsula of Mindanao. There he built a school, a hospital and a water supply system, and taught and engaged in farming and horticulture. Abaca, then the vital raw material for cordage and which Rizal and his students planted in the thousands, was a memorial.\nThe boys' school, which taught in Spanish, and included English as a foreign language (considered a prescient if unusual option then) was conceived by Rizal and antedated Gordonstoun with its aims of inculcating resourcefulness and self-sufficiency in young men. They would later enjoy successful lives as farmers and honest government officials. One, a Muslim, became a datu, and another, José Aseniero, who was with Rizal throughout the life of the school, became Governor of Zamboanga.\nIn Dapitan, the Jesuits mounted a great effort to secure his return to the fold led by Fray Francisco de Paula Sánchez, his former professor, who failed in his mission. The task was resumed by Fray Pastells, a prominent member of the Order. In a letter to Pastells, Rizal sails close to the deism familiar to us today.\n We are entirely in accord in admitting the existence of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one’s own conscience, and in consequence, it would be to doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!…I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human ‘fingernail’ and the stamp of the time in which they were written… No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.\n His best friend, professor Ferdinand Blumentritt, kept him in touch with European friends and fellow-scientists who wrote a stream of letters which arrived in Dutch, French, German and English and which baffled the censors, delaying their transmittal. Those four years of his exile coincided with the development of the Philippine Revolution from inception and to its final breakout, which, from the viewpoint of the court which was to try him, suggested his complicity in it. He condemned the uprising, although all the members of the Katipunan had made him their honorary president and had used his name as a cry for war, unity, and liberty.\nHe is known to making the resolution of bearing personal sacrifice instead of the incoming revolution, believing that a peaceful stand is the best way to avoid further suffering in the country and loss of Filipino lives. In Rizal’s own words, “I consider myself happy for being able to suffer a little for a cause which I believe to be sacred […]. I believe further that in any undertaking, the more one suffers for it, the surer its success. If this be fanaticism may God pardon me, but my poor judgment does not see it as such.”\nIn Dapitan, Rizal wrote “Haec Est Sibylla Cumana”, a parlor-game for his students, with questions and answers for which a wooden top was used. In 2004, Jean Paul Verstraeten traced this book and the wooden top, as well as Rizal’s personal watch, spoon and salter.\nArrest and trial By 1896, the rebellion fomented by the Katipunan, a militant secret society, had become a full-blown revolution, proving to be a nationwide uprising. Rizal had earlier volunteered his services as a doctor in Cuba and was given leave by Governor-General Ramón Blanco to serve in Cuba to minister to victims of yellow fever. Rizal and Josephine left Dapitan on August 1, 1896, with letter of recommendation from Blanco.\nRizal was arrested en route to Cuba via Spain and was imprisoned in Barcelona on October 6, 1896. He was sent back the same day to Manila to stand trial as he was implicated in the revolution through his association with members of the Katipunan. During the entire passage, he was unchained, no Spaniard laid a hand on him, and had many opportunities to escape but refused to do so.\nWhile imprisoned in Fort Santiago, he issued a manifesto disavowing the current revolution in its present state and declaring that the education of Filipinos and their achievement of a national identity were prerequisites to freedom.\nRizal was tried before a court-martial for rebellion, sedition and conspiracy, and was convicted on all three charges and sentenced to death. Blanco, who was sympathetic to Rizal, had been forced out of office. The friars, led by then-Archbishop of Manila Bernardino Nozaleda had ‘intercalated’ Camilo de Polavieja in his stead as the new Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines after pressuring Queen-Regent Maria Cristina of Spain, thus sealing Rizal’s fate.\nExecution Moments before his execution on December 30, 1896 by a squad of Filipino soldiers of the Spanish Army, a backup force of regular Spanish Army troops stood ready to shoot the executioners should they fail to obey orders. The Spanish Army Surgeon General requested to take his pulse: it was normal. Aware of this the sergeant commanding the backup force hushed his men to silence when they began raising “vivas” with the highly partisan crowd of Peninsular and Mestizo Spaniards. His last words were those of Jesus Christ: “consummatum est” – “it is finished.”\nHe was secretly buried in Pacò Cemetery in Manila with no identification on his grave. His sister Narcisa toured all possible gravesites and found freshly turned earth at the cemetery with guards posted at the gate. Assuming this could be the most likely spot, there never having been any ground burials, she made a gift to the caretaker to mark the site “RPJ”, Rizal’s initials in reverse.\nHis undated poem Mi último adiós, believed to have been written a few days before his execution, was hidden in an alcohol stove, which was later handed to his family with his few remaining possessions, including the final letters and his last bequests.[59]:91 During their visit, Rizal reminded his sisters in English, “There is something inside it”, referring to the alcohol stove given by the Pardo de Taveras which was to be returned after his execution, thereby emphasizing the importance of the poem. This instruction was followed by another, “Look in my shoes”, in which another item was secreted. Exhumation of his remains in August 1898, under American rule, revealed that he had been uncoffined, his burial was not on sanctified ground granted to the ‘confessed’ faithful, and whatever was in his shoes had disintegrated. He is now buried in the Rizal Monument in Manila.\nIn his letter to his family he wrote: “Treat our aged parents as you would wish to be treated…Love them greatly in memory of me…December 30, 1896.” He gave his family instructions for his burial: “Bury me in the ground. Place a stone and a cross over it. My name, the date of my birth and of my death. Nothing more. If later you wish to surround my grave with a fence, you can do it. No anniversaries.”\nIn his final letter, to Blumentritt – Tomorrow at 7, I shall be shot; but I am innocent of the crime of rebellion. I am going to die with a tranquil conscience. Rizal is believed to be the first Filipino revolutionary whose death is attributed entirely to his work as a writer; and through dissent and civil disobedience enabled him to successfully destroy Spain’s moral primacy to rule. He also bequeathed a book personally bound by him in Dapitan to his ‘best and dearest friend’. When Blumentritt received it in his hometown of Litoměřice (Leitmeritz), he broke down and wept.\nRizal’s execution, as well as those of other political dissidents (mostly anarchist) in Barcelona was ultimately invoked by Michele Angiolillo, an Italian anarchist, when he assassinated Spanish Prime Minister Antonio Canovas del Castillo.\nWorks and writings Rizal wrote mostly in Spanish, the lingua franca of the Spanish East Indies, though some of his letters (for example Sa Mga Kababaihang Taga Malolos) were written in Tagalog. His works have since been translated into a number of languages including Tagalog and English.\nNovels and essays  “El amor patrio”, 1882 essay “Toast to Juan Luna and Felix Hidalgo”, 1884 speech given at Restaurante Ingles, Madrid Noli Me Tángere, 1887 novel (literally Latin for ‘touch me not’, from John 20:17) Alin Mang Lahi (“Whate’er the Race”), a Kundiman attributed to Dr. José Rizal “Sa Mga Kababaihang Taga-Malolos” (To the Young Women of Malolos), 1889 letter Annotations to Antonio de Morga’s Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, 1889 “Filipinas dentro de cien años” (The Philippines a Century Hence), 1889–90 essay “Sobre la indolencia de los filipinos” (The Indolence of Filipinos), 1890 essay “Como se gobiernan las Filipinas” (Governing the Philippine islands), 1890 essay El filibusterismo, 1891 novel; sequel to Noli Me Tángere Una visita del Señor a Filipinas, also known as Friars and Filipinos, 14-page unfinished novel written in 1889 Memorias de un Gallo, 2-page unfinished satire Makamisa, unfinished Tagalog-language novel written in 1892  Poetry  “Felicitación” (1874/75) “El embarque” (The Embarkation, 1875) “Por la educación recibe lustre la patria” (1876) “Un recuerdo á mi pueblo” (1876) “Al niño Jesús” (c. 1876) “A la juventud filipina” (To the Philippine Youth, 1879) “¡Me piden versos!” (1882) “Canto de María Clara” (from Noli Me Tángere, 1887) “Himno al trabajo” (Dalit sa Paggawa, 1888) “Kundiman” (disputed, 1889) - also attributed to Pedro Paterno “A mi musa” (To My Muse, 1890) “El canto del viajero” (1892–96) “Mi retiro” (1895) “Mi último adiós” (1896) “Mi primera inspiracion” (disputed) - also attributed to Antonio Lopez, Rizal’s nephew  Plays  El Consejo de los Dioses (The Council of Gods) Junto al Pasig (Along the Pasig) San Euistaquio, Mártyr (Saint Eustache, the martyr)  Other works Rizal also tried his hand at painting and sculpture. His most famous sculptural work was “The Triumph of Science over Death”, a clay sculpture of a naked young woman with overflowing hair, standing on a skull while bearing a torch held high. The woman symbolized the ignorance of humankind during the Dark Ages, while the torch she bore symbolized the enlightenment science brings over the whole world. He sent the sculpture as a gift to his dear friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, together with another one named “The Triumph of Death over Life”.\nThe woman is shown trampling the skull, a symbol of death, to signify the victory the humankind achieved by conquering the bane of death through their scientific advancements. The original sculpture is now displayed at the Rizal Shrine Museum at Fort Santiago in Intramuros, Manila. A large replica, made of concrete, stands in front of Fernando Calderón Hall, the building which houses the College of Medicine of the University of the Philippines Manila along Pedro Gil Street in Ermita, Manila.\nReactions after death Retraction controversy Several historians report that Rizal retracted his anti-Catholic ideas through a document which stated: “I retract with all my heart whatever in my words, writings, publications and conduct have been contrary to my character as a son of the Catholic Church.” However, there are doubts of its authenticity given that there is no certificate of Rizal’s Catholic marriage to Josephine Bracken. Also there is an allegation that the retraction document was a forgery.\nAfter analyzing six major documents of Rizal, Ricardo Pascual concluded that the retraction document, said to have been discovered in 1935, was not in Rizal’s handwriting. Senator Rafael Palma, a former President of the University of the Philippines and a prominent Mason, argued that a retraction is not in keeping with Rizal’s character and mature beliefs. He called the retraction story a “pious fraud.” Others who deny the retraction are Frank Laubach, a Protestant minister; Austin Coates, a British writer; and Ricardo Manapat, director of the National Archives.\nThose who affirm the authenticity of Rizal’s retraction are prominent Philippine historians such as Nick Joaquin, Nicolas Zafra of UP León María Guerrero III, Gregorio Zaide, Guillermo Gómez Rivera, Ambeth Ocampo, John Schumacher, Antonio Molina, Paul Dumol and Austin Craig. They take the retraction document as authentic, having been judged as such by a foremost expert on the writings of Rizal, Teodoro Kalaw (a 33rd degree Mason) and “handwriting experts…known and recognized in our courts of justice”, H. Otley Beyer and Dr. José I. Del Rosario, both of UP.\nHistorians also refer to 11 eyewitnesses when Rizal wrote his retraction, signed a Catholic prayer book, and recited Catholic prayers, and the multitude who saw him kiss the crucifix before his execution. A great grand nephew of Rizal, Fr. Marciano Guzman, cites that Rizal’s 4 confessions were certified by 5 eyewitnesses, 10 qualified witnesses, 7 newspapers, and 12 historians and writers including Aglipayan bishops, Masons and anti-clericals. One witness was the head of the Spanish Supreme Court at the time of his notarized declaration and was highly esteemed by Rizal for his integrity.\nBecause of what he sees as the strength these direct evidence have in the light of the historical method, in contrast with merely circumstantial evidence, UP professor emeritus of history Nicolas Zafra called the retraction “a plain unadorned fact of history.” Guzmán attributes the denial of retraction to “the blatant disbelief and stubbornness” of some Masons. To explain the retraction Guzman said that the factors are the long discussion and debate which appealed to reason and logic that he had with Fr. Balaguer, the visits of his mentors and friends from the Ateneo, and the grace of God due the numerous prayers of religious communities.\nSupporters see in the retraction Rizal’s “moral courage…to recognize his mistakes,” his reversion to the “true faith”, and thus his “unfading glory,” and a return to the “ideals of his fathers” which “did not diminish his stature as a great patriot; on the contrary, it increased that stature to greatness.” On the other hand, senator Jose Diokno stated, “Surely whether Rizal died as a Catholic or an apostate adds or detracts nothing from his greatness as a Filipino… Catholic or Mason, Rizal is still Rizal – the hero who courted death ‘to prove to those who deny our patriotism that we know how to die for our duty and our beliefs’.”\n“Mi último adiós” The poem is more aptly titled “Adiós, Patria Adorada” (literally “Farewell, Beloved Fatherland”), by virtue of logic and literary tradition, the words coming from the first line of the poem itself. It first appeared in print not in Manila but in Hong Kong in 1897, when a copy of the poem and an accompanying photograph came to J. P. Braga who decided to publish it in a monthly journal he edited. There was a delay when Braga, who greatly admired Rizal, wanted a good facsimile of the photograph and sent it to be engraved in London, a process taking well over two months. It finally appeared under “Mi último pensamiento,” a title he supplied and by which it was known for a few years. Thus, the Jesuit Balaguer’s anonymous account of the retraction and the marriage to Josephine was published in Barcelona before word of the poem’s existence had reached him and he could revise what he had written. His account was too elaborate for Rizal to have had time to write “Adiós.”\nSix years after his death, when the Philippine Organic Act of 1902 was being debated in the United States Congress, Representative Henry Cooper of Wisconsin rendered an English translation of Rizal’s valedictory poem capped by the peroration, “Under what clime or what skies has tyranny claimed a nobler victim?” Subsequently, the US Congress passed the bill into law, which is now known as the Philippine Organic Act of 1902.\nThis was a major breakthrough for a U.S. Congress that had yet to grant the equal rights to African Americans guaranteed to them in the U.S. Constitution and at a time the Chinese Exclusion Act was still in effect. It created the Philippine legislature, appointed two Filipino delegates to the U.S. Congress, extended the U.S. Bill of Rights to Filipinos and laid the foundation for an autonomous government. The colony was on its way to independence. The United States passed the Jones Law that made the legislature fully autonomous until 1916 but did not recognize Philippine independence until the Treaty of Manila in 1946—fifty years after Rizal’s death. This same poem, which has inspired independence activists across the region and beyond, was recited (in its Indonesian translation by Rosihan Anwar) by Indonesian soldiers of independence before going into battle.\nLater life of Bracken Josephine Bracken, whom Rizal addressed as his wife on his last day, promptly joined the revolutionary forces in Cavite province, making her way through thicket and mud across enemy lines, and helped reloading spent cartridges at the arsenal in Imus under the revolutionary General Pantaleón García. Imus came under threat of recapture that the operation was moved, with Bracken, to Maragondon, the mountain redoubt in Cavite.\nShe witnessed the Tejeros Convention prior to returning to Manila and was summoned by the Governor-General, but owing to her stepfather’s American citizenship she could not be forcibly deported. She left voluntarily returning to Hong Kong. She later married another Filipino, Vicente Abad, a mestizo acting as agent for the Tabacalera firm in the Philippines. She died of tuberculosis in Hong Kong on March 15, 1902, and was buried at the Happy Valley Cemetery. She was immortalized by Rizal in the last stanza of Mi Ultimo Adios: “Farewell, sweet stranger, my friend, my joy…”.\nPolavieja and Blanco Polavieja faced condemnation by his countrymen after his return to Spain. While visiting Girona, in Catalonia, circulars were distributed among the crowd bearing Rizal’s last verses, his portrait, and the charge that Polavieja was responsible for the loss of the Philippines to Spain. Ramon Blanco later presented his sash and sword to the Rizal family as an apology.\nCriticism and controversies Attempts to debunk legends surrounding Rizal, and the tug of war between free thinker and Catholic, have kept his legacy controversial.\nNational hero status The confusion over Rizal’s real stance on the Philippine Revolution leads to the sometimes bitter question of his ranking as the nation’s premier hero. But then again, according to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) Section Chief Teodoro Atienza, and Filipino historian Ambeth Ocampo, there is no Filipino historical figure, including Rizal, that was officially declared as national hero through law or executive order. Although, there were laws and proclamations honoring Filipino heroes.\nMade national hero by colonial Americans Some suggest that Jose Rizal was made a legislated national hero by the American forces occupying the Philippines. In 1901, the American Governor General William Howard Taft suggested that the U.S. sponsored Philippine Commission name Rizal a national hero for Filipinos. Jose Rizal was an ideal candidate, favourable to the American occupiers since he was dead, and non-violent, a favourable quality which, if emulated by Filipinos, would not threaten the American rule or change the status quo of the occupiers of the Philippine islands. Rizal did not advocate independence for the Philippines either. Subsequently, the US-sponsored commission passed Act No. 346 which set the anniversary of Rizal’s death as a “day of observance.”\nRenato Constantino writes Rizal is a “United States-sponsored hero” who was promoted as the greatest Filipino hero during the American colonial period of the Philippines – after Aguinaldo lost the Philippine–American War. The United States promoted Rizal, who represented peaceful political advocacy (in fact, repudiation of violent means in general) instead of more radical figures whose ideas could inspire resistance against American rule. Rizal was selected over Andrés Bonifacio who was viewed “too radical” and Apolinario Mabini who was considered “unregenerate.”\nMade national hero by Emilio Aguinaldo On the other hand, numerous sources quote that it was General Emilio Aguinaldo, and not the second Philippine Commission, who first recognized December 30 as “national day of mourning in memory of Rizal and other victims of Spanish tyranny. As per them, the first celebration of Rizal Day was held in Manila on December 30, 1898, under the sponsorship of the Club Filipino.\nThe veracity of both claims seems to be justified and hence difficult to ascertain. However, most historians agree that a majority of Filipinos were unaware of Rizal during his lifetime, as he was a member of the richer elite classes (he was born in an affluent family, had lived abroad for nearly as long as he had lived in the Philippines) and wrote primarily in an elite language (at that time, Tagalog and Cebuano were the languages of the masses) about ideals as lofty as freedom (the masses were more concerned about day to day issues like earning money and making a living, something which has not changed much today).\nTeodoro Agoncillo opines that the Philippine national hero, unlike those of other countries, is not “the leader of its liberation forces”. He gives the opinion that Andrés Bonifacio not replace Rizal as national hero, like some have suggested, but that be honored alongside him.\nConstantino’s analysis has been criticised for its polemicism and inaccuracies regarding Rizal. The historian Rafael Palma, contends that the revolution of Bonifacio is a consequence wrought by the writings of Rizal and that although the Bonifacio’s revolver produced an immediate outcome, the pen of Rizal generated a more lasting achievement.\nCritiques of books Others present him as a man of contradictions. Miguel de Unamuno in “Rizal: the Tagalog Hamlet”, said of him, “a soul that dreads the revolution although deep down desires it. He pivots between fear and hope, between faith and despair.” His critics assert this character flaw is translated into his two novels where he opposes violence in Noli and appears to advocate it in Fili, contrasting Ibarra’s idealism to Simoun’s cynicism. His defenders insist this ambivalence is trounced when Simoun is struck down in the sequel’s final chapters, reaffirming the author’s resolute stance, Pure and spotless must the victim be if the sacrifice is to be acceptable.\nMany thinkers tend to find the characters of María Clara and Ibarra (Noli Me Tángere) poor role models, María Clara being too frail, and young Ibarra being too accepting of circumstances, rather than being courageous and bold.\nIn El Filibusterismo, Rizal had Father Florentino say: “…our liberty will (not) be secured at the sword’s point…we must secure it by making ourselves worthy of it. And when a people reaches that height God will provide a weapon, the idols will be shattered, tyranny will crumble like a house of cards and liberty will shine out like the first dawn.” Rizal’s attitude to the Philippine Revolution is also debated, not only based on his own writings, but also due to the varying eyewitness accounts of Pío Valenzuela, a doctor who in 1895 had consulted Rizal in Dapitan on behalf of Bonifacio and the Katipunan.\nRole in the Philippine revolution Upon the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896, Valenzuela surrendered to the Spanish authorities and testified in military court that Rizal had strongly condemned an armed struggle for independence when Valenzuela asked for his support. Rizal had even refused him entry to his house. Bonifacio, in turn, had openly denounced him as a coward for his refusal.\nHowever, years later, Valenzuela testified that Rizal had been favorable to an uprising as long as the Filipinos were well-prepared, and well-supplied with arms. Rizal had suggested that the Katipunan get wealthy and influential Filipino members of society on their side, or at least ensure they would stay neutral. Rizal had even suggested his friend Antonio Luna to lead the revolutionary forces since he had studied military science. In the event that the Katipunan was discovered prematurely, they should fight rather than allow themselves to be killed. Valenzuela said to historian Teodoro Agoncillo that he had lied to the Spanish military authorities about Rizal’s true stance toward a revolution in an attempt to exculpate him.\nBefore his execution, Rizal wrote a proclamation denouncing the revolution. But as noted by historian Floro Quibuyen, his final poem Mi ultimo adios contains a stanza which equates his coming execution and the rebels then dying in battle as fundamentally the same, as both are dying for their country.\nLegacy and remembrance Rizal was a contemporary of Gandhi, Tagore and Sun Yat Sen who also advocated liberty through peaceful means rather than by violent revolution. Coinciding with the appearance of those other leaders, Rizal from an early age had been enunciating in poems, tracts and plays, ideas all his own of modern nationhood as a practical possibility in Asia. In the Noli he stated that if European civilization had nothing better to offer, colonialism in Asia was doomed.\nThough popularly mentioned, especially on blogs, there is no evidence to suggest that Gandhi or Nehru may have corresponded with Rizal, neither have they mentioned him in any of their memoirs or letters. But it was documented by Rizal’s biographer, Austin Coates who interviewed Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi that Rizal was mentioned, specifically in Nehru’s prison letters to his daughter Indira.\nAs a political figure, José Rizal was the founder of La Liga Filipina, a civic organization that subsequently gave birth to the Katipunan led by Andrés Bonifacio, a secret society which would start the Philippine Revolution against Spain that eventually laid the foundation of the First Philippine Republic under Emilio Aguinaldo. He was a proponent of achieving Philippine self-government peacefully through institutional reform rather than through violent revolution, and would only support “violent means” as a last resort. Rizal believed that the only justification for national liberation and self-government was the restoration of the dignity of the people, saying “Why independence, if the slaves of today will be the tyrants of tomorrow?” However, through careful examination of his works and statements, including Mi Ultimo Adios, Rizal reveals himself as a revolutionary. His image as the Tagalog Christ also intensified early reverence to him.\nRizal, through his reading of Morga and other western historians, knew of the genial image of Spain’s early relations with his people. In his writings, he showed the disparity between the early colonialists and those of his day, with the latter’s injustices giving rise to Gomburza and the Philippine Revolution of 1896. The English biographer, Austin Coates, and writer, Benedict Anderson, believe that Rizal gave the Philippine revolution a genuinely national character; and that Rizal’s patriotism and his standing as one of Asia’s first intellectuals have inspired others of the importance of a national identity to nation-building.\nThe Belgian researcher Jean Paul “JP” Verstraeten authored several books about Jose Rizal: Rizal in Belgium and France, Jose Rizal’s Europe, Growing up like Rizal (published by the National Historical Institute and in teacher’s programs all over the Philippines), Reminiscences and Travels of Jose Rizal and Jose Rizal “Pearl of Unselfishness”. He received an award from the president of the Philippines “in recognition of his unwavering support and commitment to promote the health and education of disadvantaged Filipinos, and his invaluable contribution to engender the teachings and ideals of Dr. Jose Rizal in the Philippines and in Europe”. One of the greatest researchers about Rizal nowadays is Lucien Spittael.\nSeveral titles were bestowed on him: “the First Filipino”, “Greatest Man of the Brown Race”, among others. The Order of the Knights of Rizal, a civic and patriotic organization, boasts of dozens of chapters all over the globe. There are some remote-area religious sects who venerate Rizal as a Folk saint collectively known as the Rizalista religious movements, who claim him as a sublimation of Christ. In September 1903, he was canonised as a saint in the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, however it was revoked in the 1950s.\nSpecies named after Rizal José Rizal was imprisoned at Fort Santiago and soon after he was banished at Dapitan where he plunged himself into studying of nature. He then able to collect a number of species of various classes: insects, butterflies, amphibians, reptiles, shells, snakes and plants.\nRizal sent many specimens of animals, insects, and plants for identification to the (Anthropological and Ethnographical Museum of Dresden), Dresden Museum of Ethnology. It was not in his interest to receive any monetary payment; all he wanted were scientific books, magazines and surgical instruments which he needed and used in Dapitan.\nDuring his exile, Rizal also secretly sent several specimens of flying dragons to Europe. He believed that they were a new species. The German zoologist Benno Wandolleck named them Draco rizali after Rizal. However, it has since been discovered that the species had already been described by the Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1885 as Draco guentheri.\nThere are three species named after Rizal:\n Draco rizali – a small lizard, known as a flying dragon Apogania rizali – a very rare kind of beetle with five horns Rhacophorus rizali – a peculiar frog species. Rhacophorus rizali  Historical commemoration  Although his field of action lay in politics, Rizal’s real interests lay in the arts and sciences, in literature and in his profession as an ophthalmologist. Shortly after his death, the Anthropological Society of Berlin met to honor him with a reading of a German translation of his farewell poem and Dr. Rudolf Virchow delivering the eulogy. The Rizal Monument now stands near the place where he fell at the Luneta in Bagumbayan, which is now called Rizal Park, a national park in Manila. The monument, which also contains his remains, was designed by the Swiss Richard Kissling of the William Tell sculpture in Altdorf, Uri. The monument carries the inscription: “I want to show to those who deprive people the right to love of country, that when we know how to sacrifice ourselves for our duties and convictions, death does not matter if one dies for those one loves – for his country and for others dear to him.” The Taft Commission in June 1901 approved Act 137 renaming the District of Morong into the Province of Rizal. Today, the wide acceptance of Rizal is evidenced by the countless towns, streets, and numerous parks in the Philippines named in his honor. Republic Act 1425, known as the Rizal Law, was passed in 1956 by the Philippine legislature requiring all high school and colleges to offer courses about his life, works and writings. Monuments erected in his honor can be found in Madrid; Tokyo; Wilhelmsfeld, Germany; Jinjiang, Fujian, China; Chicago; Jersey City; Cherry Hill Township, New Jersey; Honolulu; San Diego; Los Angeles including the suburbs Carson and West Covina (both near Seafood City, Mexico City, Mexico; Lima, Peru; Litomerice, Czech Republic; Toronto; Markham; and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. A two-sided marker bearing a painting of Rizal by Fabián de la Rosa on one side and a bronze bust relief of him by Philippine artist Guillermo Tolentino stands at the Asian Civilisations Museum Green marking his visits to Singapore in 1882, 1887, 1891 and 1896. A Rizal bronze bust was erected at La Molina district, Lima, Peru, designed by Czech sculptor Hanstroff, mounted atop a pedestal base with four inaugural plaque markers with the following inscription on one: “Dr. José P. Rizal, Héroe Nacional de Filipinas, Nacionalista, Reformador Political, Escritor, Lingüistica y Poeta, 1861–1896.” A Rizal bust sits in front of the Filipino American Council of Chicago, celebrating a one-day visit Dr. Rizal made to Chicago on May 11, 1888, as seen below. A plaque marks the Wilhelmsfeld building where he trained with Professor Becker. There is a small park in Wilhelmsfeld named after Rizal with a bronze statue of Rizal, and the street where he lived on was also renamed after him. Wilhelmsfeld’s local government gifted the sandstone fountain in Pastor Ullmer’s house garden where Rizal lived to the Philippine government and is now located at Rizal Park in Manila. In Heidelberg, a small stretch along the Neckar River is named after Rizal. In 2014, a commemorative sandstone plaque was placed there in Rizal’s honor. Throughout 2011, the National Historical Institute and other institutions organized several activities commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Rizal, which took place on June 19 of that year. The London Borough of Camden placed a Blue Plaque at 37 Chalcot Crescent, where Rizal lived for some time, with the words: “Dr. José Rizal, Writer and National Hero of the Philippines”. A monument in honor of Rizal was planned, and built in Rome. In the City of Philadelphia, the ‘City of Murals’ first Filipino mural in the US east coast honoring José Rizal was to unveiled to the public in time for Rizal’s Sesquicentennial year-long celebration. A street in Chanakyapuri, the Diplomatic Enclave of New Delhi, India, is named Dr. Jose P. Rizal Marg The Grand Oriental Hotel in Colombo, Sri Lanka has a suite named after Jose P. Rizal as he had stayed there in May 1882. Nearly every town and city in the Philippines contains a street named after Rizal (Rizal street and Rizal Avenue) At least ten towns / cities in the Philippines are named “Rizal” (for example: Rizal – Cagayan) A road in the Chanakyapuri area of New Delhi (India) is named Dr. Jose P Rizal Marg. A road in Medan, Indonesia is named Jalan Jose Rizal after him. The USS Rizal (DD-174) was a Wickes-class destroyer named after Rizal by the United States Navy and launched on September 21, 1918. The José Rizal Bridge and Rizal Park in the city of Seattle are dedicated to Rizal. On 19 June 2019, on Rizal’s 158th birthday, he was honored with a Google Doodle. A bronze bust of Rizal by F.B. Case was gifted to the City of Toronto by the Government of the Philippines in 1998. It is located at Earl Bales Park in the neighbourhood of Lansing. A monument by Mogi Mogado was unveiled at Luneta Gardens (similar name as the park where Rizal is buried - Luneta Park or now as Rizal Park) in 2019 as a gift from the Filipino Canadian community of Markham to the City of Markham. It is located in the Box Grove area of Markham, Ontario near Rizal Avenue, which is also named for him. A Jose Rizal-class frigate of the Philippine Navy was built by Hyundai Heavy Industries. Two ships were ordered in 2016. They are the first guided missile frigate to enter service with the Philippine Navy. The lead ship, BRP Jose Rizal, arrived in the Philippines on May 22, 2020.  Rizal in popular culture Adaptation of his works The cinematic depiction of Rizal’s literary works won two film industry awards more than a century after his birth. In the 10th FAMAS Awards, he was honored in the Best Story category for Gerardo de León’s adaptation of his book Noli Me Tángere. The recognition was repeated the following year with his movie version of El Filibusterismo, making him the only person to win back-to-back FAMAS Awards posthumously.\nBoth novels were translated into opera by the composer-librettist Felipe Padilla de León: Noli me tangere in 1957 and El filibusterismo in 1970; and his 1939 overture, Mariang Makiling, was inspired by Rizal’s tale of the same name.\nAng Luha at Lualhati ni Jeronima is a film inspired by the third chapter of Rizal’s El filibusterismo.\nBiographical films/TV series  Portrayed by Eddie del Mar in the 1956 film, Ang Buhay at Pag-ibig ni Dr. Jose Rizal Portrayed by Albert Martinez in the 1997 film, Rizal sa Dapitan Portrayed by Dominic Guinto and Cesar Montano in the 1998 biographical film, José Rizal Portrayed by Joel Torre in the 1999 mockumentary film, Bayaning 3rd World Portrayed by Nasser in the 2013 TV series, Katipunan Portrayed by Jhiz Deocareza and Alden Richards in the 2014 TV series, Ilustrado.

(officially written and stylized as ultraelectromagneticpop!) is the debut studio album of the Filipino alternative rock band Eraserheads, released by BMG Records (Pilipinas), Inc. in 1993. Ultraelectromagneticpop! spawned hit songs such as “Ligaya”, “Toyang”, and “Pare Ko”. The album brought the underground Philippine college rock scene into public awareness and the emergence of “Eraserheadsmania” because of successive hit singles and sold-out concerts.\nBackground Though Ultraelectromagneticpop! was their debut album, most of the songs were recycled from original compositions that were written since their college days in 1989. Hoping to have their songs published, the band recorded a demo tape in 1991 and shopped around record labels and radio stations, only to be rejected at every turn. A friend-professor, Robin Rivera, from their school, UP Diliman, helped them record an improved version of the demo tape which was named Pop U!, a play on the invective “fuck you,” in response to the people who turned them down. After a year of being passed around the underground music scene, the demo tape made its way to the hands of BMG Records (Philippines), who signed a three-year contract with the band.\nThe title of the album is a pun on ultraelectromagnetic tops, a fictional weapon from the anime serial Voltes V, which was immensely popular in the Philippines.\nRecording The recording of Ultraelectromagneticpop! started on July 1992 to April 1993 with crazy working titles like “Lutong Bahay”, “Pekaloid”, “The Klasik Kapums Konsert Kookout”, and “Eraserheads Greatest Hits Vol. 5”. at Ad \u0026 Ad Recording Studio and JR Recording Studio.\nBased on their production notes, they somewhat had a hard time during their recording sessions. It was stated that there are two things on their recording sessions : Heaven and Hell.\nHell: Ac and Ad. Brownouts, floods, rain, wait ancient equipment, No DAT, Ed Formoso, master recording machine kept slowing down and breaking up.\nHeaven: JR Recording. Groovy engineer, Mr. Willie (the screen) Munji. Freedom! Experimentation. Everything we wanted. Good food, sound, equipment (d-drums! effects! sofa!)\nRelease The album was released by BMG Records (Pilipinas) under the label’s local division, Musiko Records in July 1993. The album was originally issued on both compact disc and cassette tape formats with the respective catalog numbers: MRCD-032 and MRMC-032. Original issue cassettes featured full-color sticker labels on both sides.\nIn 2008, the album was re-released together with the band’s other albums.\n25th anniversary remastered version Coinciding with the album’s 25th anniversary, a remastered edition of Ultraelectromagneticpop! was released on November 21, 2018 under Sony Music Philippines and Offshore Music. Ely Buendia made the first announcement on his Instagram and Facebook accounts. The album was remastered by Grammy award-winning American audio engineer Bernie Grundman. In January 2019, Buendia revealed through his independent record label, Offshore Music, along with Sony Music, that the master tapes of the Eraserheads' first album, Ultraelectromagneticpop!, are currently being archived by the University of the Philippines Center for Ethnomusicology for the album’s cultural significance.\nTrack listing No.\tTitle (Writer) Length\n “Easy Ka Lang” (Buendia)\t4:23 “Maling Akala” (Buendia, Marasigan) 4:11 “Pare Ko” (Buendia) 5:11 “Shake Yer Head”\t(Buendia)\t3:52 “Ganjazz” (Adoro, Buendia, Marasigan, Zabala, Jojo Bacasmas) 0:37 “Toyang” (Adoro, Buendia) 3:45 “Ligaya”\t(Buendia) 4:16 “Tindahan ni Aling Nena”\t(Buendia) 3:04 “Honky-Toinks Granny” (Adoro) 1:04 “Shirley” (Buendia, Marasigan) 4:00 “Walang Hiyang Pare Ko”\t(Buendia) 5:11 “Combo on the Run” (Buendia, Marasigan) 3:58  Total length:\t43:32\nAll tracks produced by Ed Formoso except “Maling Akala”, “Ganjazz”, “Toyang”, “Hoinky-Toinks Granny”, “Shirley”, and “Combo on the Run”, which were produced by Dem.\nLegacy The release of Ultraelectromagneticpop! gave way to other Filipino bands to splash onto the Philippine Alternative Music Scene and also saw the emergence of the so-called “90’s Rock Revolution” in the Philippines. Notes\n “Pare Ko” and “Walang Hiyang Pare Ko” are actually the same song. The latter is a clean, radio-friendly version of the former. “Walang Hiyang Pare Ko” does not appear on the 2018 remastered version of the album. Toyang\" was slightly inspired by “Too Young,” a composition written by Sylvia Dee and Sidney Lippman which was well known for Nat King Cole’s rendition. The song also makes reference to several Filipino folk songs and as well as the Paul McCartney-penned “Silly Love Songs”. Buendia’s inspiration behind the song was his then long time college girlfriend, Victoria Cayago. “Ganjazz” was a jazz version of “Honky-Toinks Granny” and was recorded with Jojo Bacasmas on vocals. “Honky-Toinks Granny” was a country version of “Ganjazz”. The album has a modified version of the Parental Advisory sticker in the cover art of the original release (see infobox). It reads: “Parental Advisory: Some songs may not be suitable for children (but there isn’t anything in this album that your kids haven’t heard before!)” The Parental Advisory is removed in the 25th Anniversary edition cover.

Sa halimbawa sa tanong, may obligasyon ang kumpanyang magbayad ng halagang 1,800 yen o higit pa sa bawat 1 oras. ▸Sanggunian ang 1.16\n Q8. Nang humingi ako sa kumpanya ng 3 tuloy-tuloy na araw ng taunang bayad na bakasyon, sinabihan ako ng kumpanya na hindi mapahihintulutan ang pagkuha ng taunang bakasyon dahil patuloy ang kakulangan sa tauhan. Wala bang problema dito? Answer: Sa patakaran, kailangang ibigay ang taunang bayad na bakasyon sa “panahong hiniling ng manggagawa.” Ang kongkretong petsang itinalaga ng manggagawa ang araw na ibibigay bilang taunang bakasyon, at sa patakaran maaaring magpasya ang manggagawa kung paghahati-hatiin o kukunin niya ng tuloy-tuloy ang taunang bakasyon. Sa kabilang banda, kung “sasagabal sa wastong pagpapatakbo ng negosyo” ang pagbibigay ng bakasyon sa panahong itinalaga ng manggagawa, maaaring gamitin ng employer ang karapatan sa pagbabago ng panahon upang gawin ang pagsasaayos sa pagpapatakbo ng negosyo, ngunit hindi pinahihintulutan bilang kadahilanan ng karapatan sa pagbabago ng panahon ang “patuloy na kakulangan sa tauhan.” ▸Sanggunian ang 1.17\n Q9. Sinabihan ako ng empleyadong nakatatanda o nauna sa akin na magpatakbo ng forklift sa pabrika. Maaari ba akong magpatakbo nito kahit wala akong partikular na lisensya o kwalipikasyon para rito? Answer: Kung ipapatakbo ng nagpapatakbo ng negosyo ang forklift sa loob ng pabrika, kailangang ipagawa ito sa taong nagtapos ng bukod-tanging edukasyon kapag forklift na walang 1 ton ang maximum na bigat ng kargada, o sa taong nagtapos ng teknikal na kurso sa pagpapatakbo ng forklift kapag forklift na 1 ton o higit pa ang maximum na bigat ng kargada. ▸Sanggunian ang 4.03\n Q10. Hindi ako makapagtrabaho dahil nagkapinsala ako sa katawan habang nagtatrabaho. Binabayaran ng kumpanya ang gastusin sa pagpapagamot, ngunit hindi ako nakakatanggap ng kabayaran para sa sahod sa panahong lumiliban ako sa trabaho. Answer: Ipinaiiral ang seguro para sa sakuna sa trabaho sa lahat ng manggagawa kasama ang mga dayuhang manggagawa. Sa seguro para sa sakuna sa trabaho, kung hindi makapagtrabaho at hindi makatanggap ng sahod dahil nagpapagaling para sa pinsala sa katawan o sakit na natamo sa pagtatrabaho o sa pagpasok sa o pag-uwi mula sa trabaho, maaaring tumanggap ng benepisyo (kabayaran) sa pagliban sa trabaho mula sa ika-4 na araw ng pagliban sa trabaho.\nMangyari lamang na magkonsulta kaagad sa Labour Standards Inspection Office. ▸Sanggunian ang 5.\n 7.

He is currently the bassist of Filipino pop band Moonstar88 and indie band Cambio, and widely known as the member of the formerly disbanded and now reunited alternative rock band, Eraserheads. He also served as bassist to The Dawn and Hilera.\nEarly life Zabala was born in Zamboanga City, Philippines and attended University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City.\nEraserheads bassist (1989–2003) Zabala only began writing and singing songs as an Eraserhead starting with the band’s 1996 Christmas album, Fruitcake. The album contains “The Fabulous Baker Boy” and “Fruit Fairy.” Buddy later also sang and wrote “Tama Ka” and “Kahit Ano” in the 1999 album, Natin99.\nBuddy’s bass-playing is prominently featured in the drum \u0026 bass opening track of the Natin99 album, “Sinturong Pangkaligtasan”. In Aloha Milkyway (the band’s first international release), the songs were heavy with his bass work.\nPost-Eraserheads (2003–present) A few years after the dissolution of the Eraserheads, Buddy Zabala continues to be a prolific musician. He plays bass for The Dawn and, of course, the renamed Eheads, Cambio. Intervening bands in which he was played were the Sun Valley Crew (together with fellow Eraserhead, Raimund Marasigan) and Twisted Halo (with Vin Dancel, Jason Caballa, Joey Odulio, and Mon Lopez.).\nFor his bass work for Cambio (Derby Light) and Twisted Halo (In Loving Memory of the Fearless Exploits of the Bolo Brigade), Zabala was awarded by the NU Rock Awards as 2004 “Bassist of the Year”.\nAside from playing with his bands and doing session work, he focuses his energy in helping younger generation of Pinoy rock bands by way of producing their albums. Some of these are Boldstar’s “You Must Have Been a Beautiful Something/What Are You, Really?”, Itchyworms' “Little Monsters Under your Bed” (with Romel Sanchez), 6 Cycle Mind’s “Panorama”, Moonstar 88’s “Todo Combo”, and Imago’s “Blush”.\nHe also works as co-producer with his Eraserheads and Cambio colleague, Raimund Marasigan; such as on Itchyworms' “Noon Time Show,” Twisted Halo’s “Twisted Halo EP”, Fatal Posporos' “Paper View,” Sugarfree’s “Dramachine,” Cambio’s “Derby Light,” and Imago’s “Take 2.” He was also involved for Marasigan’s recent “Five on the Floor” album for Sandwich’s.\nZabala had also scored a number of movies, TV commercials, documentary shorts and stage plays.\nIn late 2015, Zabala replaced Hilera’s bassist, Ivan Garcia who left the band due to personal reasons. A year later, Zabala left The Dawn due to unknown reasons and was replaced by the returning Carlos Balcells.\nStarted July 2017, working with Raymund Marasigan, currently working as producers for Coke Studio Philippines. Coke Studio Philippines is a brand new musical program that brings artists of different backgrounds and genres together to fuse their music into unique, new Pinoy sounds, shown on YouTube.\nFilmography  Run Barbi Run as himself (Eraserheads) Tulad Ng Dati as himself (The Dawn)  Adapted from Wikipedia, under Creative Commons license.\n","categories":"","description":"Filipino musician","excerpt":"Filipino musician","ref":"/wiki/buddy-zabala/","tags":"","title":"Buddy Zabala"},{"body":"ICHI, ITSU hito, hito(tsu) JLPT:5 Grade:1 Strokes:1 Freq:2\nAng pinakasimpleng kanji sa lahat, isang horizontal line na ibig sabihin ay “isa”.
