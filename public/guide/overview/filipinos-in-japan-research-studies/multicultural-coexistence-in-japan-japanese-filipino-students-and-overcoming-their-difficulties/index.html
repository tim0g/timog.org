    <p><strong>Author: Sena Nukata</strong></p>
<p>Due to decreasing birthrates and the economic needs, the demand for foreign labor forces becomes strong. The discussion for accepting migrant workers has become popular among the public. When we think about accepting foreigners into the country in the future, it is important to consider the situation of the foreigners who live in Japan today.</p>
<p>We have a long history of study about the “old comers” such as Koreans and Chinese. A lot of researches on the “new comers” who came to Japan after 1990 have been conducted, especially about Japanese Brazilians and Peruvians. On the other hand, Filipino migrants are not well-covered because of their various backgrounds and widely dispersed in Japan.</p>
<p>In this paper, by analyzing Japanese-Filipino Children or JFC, who have Japanese fathers and Filipina mothers, I would like to discuss the following questions:</p>
<p>1 What kind of difficulties do marginalized people (JFC) have?
2 How does the Japanese institutional system (school system) support marginalized people (JFC)?</p>
