<ul>
<li>2 Letterpack Plus envelopes (1 self-addressed envelope that you will submit during the application, and 1 to send your current passport to the Consular Section when your new passport is ready)</li>

</div>

<p>520-yen Letterpack Plus (red) envelopes and postcards (hagaki) are sold in Post Offices and convenience stores, although some branches might not have them.</p>
<p>Write the numbers and letters clearly. Japanese mailmen are not so familiar reading addresses in Romaji so you might want to make their work easier by writing in big, clear characters.</p>
<p>Write the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Postal code</li>
<li>Complete address down to the <strong>apartment number</strong></li>
<li>Your name (last name and first name is enough)</li>
<li>Phone number (only on the Letterpack Plus)</li>
</ul>

<p>Actually, you write your address and name <em>vertically</em> on postcards but it might not be practical with Romaji, having lots of letters.</p>
