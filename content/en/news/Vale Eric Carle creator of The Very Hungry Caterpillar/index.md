<p>Eric Carle, author and illustrator of beloved children’s book, <a href="https://eric-carle.com/eric-carle-book-gallery/the-very-hungry-caterpillar-1969/">The Very Hungry Caterpillar</a>, died on Sunday — the same day his famous caterpillar is born.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One Sunday morning, the warm sun came up — and pop! — out of the egg came a very tiny and hungry caterpillar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Described by author Mo Willems as a “<a href="https://twitter.com/The_Pigeon/status/1397698610125488129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">gentleman with a mischievous charm</a>”,  Carle might have appreciated the irony. </p>

<p>All living things grow and change and die.</p>

<p>But while a caterpillar’s life is spectacularly short, Carle lived for 91 years. He wrote <a href="https://eric-carle.com/books/english-language/">more than 70 books</a>. His most celebrated, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, is frequently cited as one of the <a href="https://blogs.slj.com/afuse8production/2012/06/28/top-100-picture-books-2-the-very-hungry-caterpillar-by-eric-carle/">best picture books</a> of all time. With just 224 words, it has sold roughly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/22/booksforchildrenandteenagers">a copy per minute</a> since its publication in 1969.</p>

<h2>Growing wings</h2>

<p>Despite The Very Hungry Caterpillar’s success, Carle always seemed baffled by the persistent buzz.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9o-QtoPeE">2014</a>, when asked about the book’s popularity, Carle responded, “I haven’t come up with an answer, but I think it’s a book of hope”. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/14/garden/studio-with-eric-carle-for-children-very-simple-stories-with-very-vibrant-art.html">A decade earlier</a>, he seemed more settled on the idea: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remember that as a child, I always felt I would never grow up and be big and articulate and intelligent. ‘Caterpillar’ is a book of hope: you, too, can grow up and grow wings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remarkably, Carle remained humble. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9o-QtoPeE">interview</a> he gave not long before his death, Carle quietly acknowledged the importance of his work. </p>

<p>“You know, now it’s sinking in,” he said. “It’s taken me a long time to realise, and it is sinking in.”</p>

<p><div data-react-class="InstagramEmbed" data-react-props="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CPWoGWJLH7I&quot;}"></div></p>

<h2>A glimmer of hope</h2>

<p>Like many children’s authors, Carle enlists fantasy to serve the narrative. He speaks to children through animals and insects. In books like <a href="https://eric-carle.com/eric-carle-book-gallery/brown-bear-brown-bear-what-do-you-see/">Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</a> (written by Bill Martin) he gives agency to bugs and beetles, and situates the smallest creatures on the same continuum as humans. His work comforts us. The predictable and non-controversial behaviour of animals is reassuring. </p>

<p>Unlike humans, animals are consistent.</p>

<p>Carle’s caterpillar might be gluttonous, but at least he is true to himself. And he doesn’t apologise for his appetite. He is very hungry, after all.</p>

<p>(Carle is quoted in a Paris Review interview as saying he <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/the-art-of-fiction-carle">fought his publisher</a> over the inclusion of the punitive stomach ache.)</p>

<p>The book hasn’t been without controversy.</p>

<p>Both George W. Bush and Hilary Clinton read the book to children on their campaign trails — with Bush <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/22/booksforchildrenandteenagers">earning digs</a> for refusing to read any other books, and naming Caterpillar as his favourite children’s book, even though it came out when he was 23. </p>

<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics uses the book as a learning tool to promote healthy eating and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/is-that-right-the-very-hungry-caterpillar-teaches-kids-to-eat-right/2011/03/17/ABFoenl_story.html">educate about the risks of obesity</a> — even though <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/the-art-of-fiction-carle">Carle is quoted as saying</a> he didn’t “recognise childhood obesity […] no one should”. </p>

<h2>A book full of holes</h2>

<p>A child of wartime trauma, with a background in graphic design and advertising, Carle was playing around with a hole punch when he had the idea for a story about a bookworm. The Very Hungry Caterpillar was originally titled A Week with Willi the Worm. But Carle’s first choice of critter was abandoned at the suggestion of his editor, <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-authors/article/85889-obituary-ann-k-beneduce.html">Ann Beneduce</a>, who insisted worms didn’t make likeable characters.</p>

<p>Thus, The Very Hungry Caterpillar emerged, followed by <a href="https://eric-carle.com/eric-carle-book-gallery/the-very-busy-spider-1984/">The Very Busy Spider</a>, <a href="https://eric-carle.com/eric-carle-book-gallery/the-very-quiet-cricket-1990/">The Very Quiet Cricket</a>, and <a href="https://eric-carle.com/eric-carle-book-gallery/the-very-lonely-firefly-1995/">The Very Lonely Firefly</a>.</p>

<p>Carle went on to write about grouchy ladybugs, dejected chameleons, even homeless hermit crabs — but never a worm.</p>

<h2>Art of wonder</h2>

<p>Despite his prolific publishing career, Carle didn’t think of himself as an author, preferring instead the term “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/eric-carle-creating-hungry-caterpillar-wanted-call-willi-worm/">picture writer</a>”.</p>

<p>His style is distinct: minimalist text, vibrant illustrations and a multisensory reading experience that moves beyond the simple turning of a page.</p>

<p>The Very Lonely Firefly, for example, includes a set of battery-operated twinkling lights. Mister Seahorse, the story of a fish father who cares for his babies, contains transparent inserts printed with sea environments that can be overlayed as semi-opaque pages. </p>

<p>In Caterpillar, the page width is progressively increased to reflect the quantity of food consumed. Each image of food has a caterpillar-sized hole cutout, as if it has been chomped through. </p>

<p>Ultimately, after some mild abdominal pain and a medicinal green leaf, he transforms into a handsome butterfly.</p>

<div class="yt"><iframe width="440" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkYmvxP0AJI?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<figcaption><span class="caption">‘On Monday, he ate through one apple, but he was still hungry…’</span></figcaption>
          

<p>Carle’s multifaceted practice, combined with his distinctive visual language, transforms his books into objects of wonder and play, lending themselves to repeated readings.</p>

<p>Moreover, while Carle’s images are carefully constructed through technical processes, his work maintains a childlike quality.</p>

<p>His images reflect how children see their world — a series of bold shapes, exaggerated features and fields of moving colour (an effect achieved by <a href="https://blog.dct.org/tissue-paper-transformations-eric-carles-famous-collages-go-from-page-to-stage/">collaging on hand-painted tissue</a>). </p>

<p>Indeed, Carle’s bold and bright colours are particularly effective given what we know about the <a href="https://sciencing.com/how-to-teach-about-the-solar-system-to-children-12741679.html">developmental stages</a> of a child’s vision: younger children are better able to perceive and distinguish between bright colours than fainter shades.</p>

<p>Carle called his work “deceptively simple”, a great accomplishment for a man, who — in his words — tried “all his life to simplify things”.</p>
