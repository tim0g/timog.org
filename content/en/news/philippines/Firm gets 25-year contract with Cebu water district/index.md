**CEBU CITY** –  Power company Vivant Corp. on Monday announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Vivant Hydrocore Holdings Inc. (VHHI), has been awarded a 25-year bulk water supply agreement by the Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD).

This was disclosed by the company in a statement to the Philippine Stock Exchange after it received notice from its water infrastructure unit.

“MCWD concluded a successful bid for the Cordova Bulk Water Supply Project through a solicited proposal with VHHI as the private sector proponent and Watermatic Philippines Corporation (WMP) as its technical partner,” the statement of the company, owned by the Garcia-Escaño family of Cebu, read.

The firm said VHHI will build a utility-scale desalination plant that will augment the limited bulk water supply of MCWD cubic meters by 20,000 cubic meters per day of treated and potable water.

“This investment in bulk water supply is a key milestone for the Vivant group to deliver on its promise to provide forward-looking and adaptable solutions for its communities,” the listed company said.

The Vivant Group is set to sign a joint venture agreement with MCWD to govern the relationship of the parties as joint venture partners.

VHHI is a wholly-owned unit of Vivant Infracore Holdings Inc., which is in turn wholly owned by Vivant Corp. VHHI holds the group’s water infrastructure investment portfolio.

Water supply has been one of Cebu’s major economic challenges in recent years, with the increased urbanization in the metropolitan area.

The water demand is expected to increase with the rising economic activities and growing industries in Cebu.

The fast population growth in Metro Cebu is also increasing the pressure on existing systems of water supply.

The expanding urbanization and the rising population are two major factors cited to have intensified the challenges related to water quality and wastewater treatment. (PNA)
