**MANILA CITY** –  The Valenzuela city government has started inoculating its indigent residents since Sunday.

In a social media post on Monday, the city government announced that some 1,200 beneficiaries of the government's Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), or those belonging to the "poorest of the poor" sector, received their first shots of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines at the City Astrodome on Sunday.

The Department of Health (DOH) implementing guidelines stated that the A5 priority group beneficiaries will be based on the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR) or other verification mechanisms of the local government.

"As identified and validated, additional poor populations shall also be eligible and Valenzuela City first targets individuals listed under the city’s 4Ps," the city said in a statement.

The City Social Welfare and Development Office said there are 14,273 active beneficiaries of the 4Ps program in Valenzuela alone, part of the 51,900 indigents lined up for vaccination.

The city government provides technical assistance for indigents who are unable to register at the ValTrace portal.

Valenzuela City's active Covid-19 cases are down to 208 on Monday, from the reported 283 active cases, on June 16.

The latest data showed 111, 246 residents have received their first dose. (PNA)
