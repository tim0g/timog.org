**MANILA CITY** –  Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III underscored Tuesday the importance for young Filipinos to be at the forefront of national efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change, as they have the biggest stake in saving the planet from the environmental crisis that will "hit us like a tsunami" unless its "destructive course" is halted.
 
Youths who will have to face the worst effects of climate change as these intensify over time comprise the last generation that can end the planet’s environmental destruction, he said. 
 
“Climate change is happening. It is real. We see its effects in our daily lives. People do not realize it, but climate change will hit us like a tsunami if we continue to do nothing about this worsening crisis. It could wipe away all our economic gains in one go if we fail to mitigate it,” Dominguez said at the opening this morning of Sulong Pilipinas 2021: Climate Change and the New Normal with the Youth Sector. 
 
Dominguez told over 500 leaders and members of various youth organizations gathered virtually for the event that the participation of today’s young generation is critical in achieving the country’s climate ambition and in building “a greener, healthier, and climate-resilient future” for the planet. 
 
“As bearers of the future, the youth--who will have to live through 2030 and beyond--have the greatest stake in overcoming this crisis. It is therefore very important that you understand this issue and take the lead in reversing this destructive course,” said Dominguez, who is concurrent chairman-designate of the Climate Change Commission (CCC). 
 
He said the greatest defense that can be mounted in this battle is climate literacy, which is why the government is utilizing the Sulong Pilipinas forum to raise public awareness and spur climate action, especially among the youth.
  
“Today, we recognize and celebrate the crucial role of the youth in our society. You are the last generation that can end the climate crisis,” he said. 
 
The next period following the end of the Covid-19 emergency will be “one of multifold challenges,” as “we have a country to redeem from the ravages of the pandemic,” “an economy to rebuild,” and “a planet to save from the carelessness of past generations,” he added. 
 
Dominguez told the participants that their fresh insights and perspectives will prove valuable in forming the government’s climate policies that will help shape the course of their future. 
 
He called on the youth to “reimagine everything” in crafting solutions to the climate crisis. 
 
“You are capable of coming up with ambitious, creative and doable ideas that can make a lasting difference,” Dominguez said. “We need your determination to build a greener, healthier and climate-resilient future. We want you to use your talents, knowledge, and passion to achieve our climate ambition.” (PR)
