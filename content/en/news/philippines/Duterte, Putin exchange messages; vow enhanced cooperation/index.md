**MANILA** –  President Rodrigo Duterte and Russian President Vladimir Putin exchanged congratulatory messages Saturday during their celebration of national holidays, promising enhanced bilateral relations.

“On this day of national unity and celebration, let me convey the Filipino people’s best wishes for the continued success and prosperity of your great nation,” said Duterte, warmly congratulating Putin on the celebration of Russia Day. “This year, the Philippines and Russia mark 45 years of warm and fruitful ties. It was my great pleasure to have commemorated this special milestone with Your Excellency on the 2nd of June.”

“I am confident that our strong relations will continue to thrive in the years ahead as we deepen cooperation in more areas of mutual interest, including in our common fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,” he added.

In a similar message, Putin expressed his greetings to Duterte for the Philippines’ 123rd Independence Day celebration.

“The Russia-Philippines relations are traditionally friendly. I am confident that by joining efforts we will secure further development on constructive bilateral dialogue, fruitful cooperation in different fields as well as partnership to respond to pressing international challenges,” Putin told Duterte. “It fully meets the interests of our two nations and goes in line with strengthening security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.”

Concluding his message, he wished Duterte good health and success, and the people of the Philippines well-being and prosperity.

Before their June 2 conversation, Duterte and Putin also had a telesummit in April, tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and defense cooperation.
