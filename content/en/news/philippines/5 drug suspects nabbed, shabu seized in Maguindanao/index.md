**DATU ODIN SINSUAT, MAGUINDANAO** –  Anti-narcotics agents arrested five suspects, including a woman, during a drug buy-bust operation here Tuesday afternoon.

Director Juvenal Azurin of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency - Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (PDEA-BARMM) said an undercover agent managed to secure several sachets of suspected shabu from one of the five in Barangay Pinguiaman here at past 4 p.m.

About 20 grams of shabu in separate sachets, with an estimated street value of PHP136,000, were confiscated from the suspects.

“We have also dismantled their drug den in the process,” Azurin told reporters.

Arrested were Michael Ala Hamiron, the principal target of the operation; his wife Normia Camsa Ala Salazar; Anton Vasquez Abo; Thobie Sultan Guimablang; and Jomar Andong Liwa.

Neighbors have alerted authorities on the illegal activities of the group in the area, according to PDEA-Maguindanao head agent Anthony Naïve.

“They can no longer tolerate what these people are doing for fear their children might fall victims to drug addiction,” Naïve said, referring to residents who tipped off the PDEA about the illegal activities.

The suspects are detained at the PDEA detention facility in Cotabato City.

Charges for violation of Republic Act 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) are being prepared against them. (PNA)
