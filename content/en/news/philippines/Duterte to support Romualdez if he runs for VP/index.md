**MANILA CITY** –  President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday said he will support House Majority Leader and Leyte 1st District Rep. Martin Romualdez should he run for vice president in the 2022 national elections.

Duterte said he made this promise to Romualdez to end the speakership rivalry between his allies in 2019.

Romualdez, who was the top contender in the speakership race at the time, dropped out of the speakership race and accepted Duterte's suggestion to be Majority Leader instead.

Taguig 1st District Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano and Marinduque Rep. Lord Velasco entered into a gentlemen’s agreement that would give Cayetano the first 15 months as Speaker while Velasco would take over for 21 months or until Congress adjourned.

“Pag tumakbo si Romualdez (If Romualdez runs), I will support him. ‘Yan ang pinangako ko. So walang problema (That’s what I promised. So there’s no problem). I said I will honor my word,” Duterte said in a speech in Malacañan Palace.

He explained that whether he will run as vice president will depend on Romualdez’s decision.

“Ang politics ko (My politics) is just a small window. Whether I run for [vice] president or not, but it is dependent on the word of honor that I gave Romualdez. ‘Pag tumakbo siya (If he runs), count me out. But I will support him because I promised him. Para lang ma-break yung impasse noon. ‘Yun ang formula namin. Hindi ninyo alam ‘yan (Just to break the impasse before. That’s our formula. You didn’t know that),” he said.

Duterte acknowledged that there were “a lot of people” pushing him to run for the country’s highest elected office.

Late last month, ruling party Partido Demokratikong Pilipino (PDP)-Laban issued a resolution seeking to convince him to run for vice president.

He admitted that he still had remaining campaign promises to keep, such as eliminating the illegal drug trade and improving the country’s infrastructure.

“Marami pang iba na hindi ko nagawa (There are many promises I haven’t accomplished yet). I promised about four things. Corruption, I’m doing it. I’m firing people left and right sa gobyerno (in government). Then I promised criminality and I think na medyo bumaba na ang crimes against the people (have lessened). Ang isa pa yung droga (And one more thing is drugs) and to pursue other infrastructure projects,” he said.

Duterte said that running for the country’s second-highest office was tempting, but he had to honor his deal with Romualdez.

“Maybe being a vice president would be good except that nung they were jogging the positions for the so many contenders si Lord pati si, eto totohanan (this is the truth), it’s a public confession, pati (and) Alan Peter Cayetano, sinabi ko hatiin an lang ninyo (I said split the term). But the problem is there was a serious contender also for the speakership, si Congressman Romualdez,” he said.

He recalled how Romualdez is part of a term-sharing deal that should be honored by all parties involved.

“Kaya ang deal ko sa kanya ganito, ‘Huwag ka na lang maghabol diyan (That’s why my deal to him went like this ‘Don’t run after that position) and next election, which is just around the corner, if you run for vice president, I will support you.’ And I will hold on to that commitment. ‘Pag tumakbo si Romauldez, wala ako. ‘Pag hindi tumakbo si Romualdez, wala rin ako siguro (If Romualdez runs, I won’t. If he doesn’t run, I probably won’t either),” he said.

Meanwhile, Duterte said he was looking forward to retiring after he steps down as president.

“Everybody wants a good rest after a grueling…inshallah makaabot ako sa finish line. So ‘yan ang totoo diyan. So useless itong talking about vice president running (God willing, I will reach the finish line. So it’s useless to talk about joining the vice presidential race),” he said.

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque earlier said Duterte will run for vice president in next year's polls if he receives “a message from God.” (PNA)
