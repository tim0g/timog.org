**MANILA CITY** –  Philippine National Police (PNP) chief, Gen. Guillermo Eleazar on Wednesday pledged their full cooperation in the ongoing investigation of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) on the police abduction allegation involving three persons in Manila.

He said the PNP will coordinate with the NBI after two suspects in the kidnapping of Rexcell John Hipolito, 23; Ronald Jae Dizon, 21; and Ivan Serrano, 18 claimed that policemen were behind the abduction.

The two suspects, who incidentally are brothers and claimed to be police assets, are now in the custody of the NBI and would possibly be placed under the government’s witness protection program.

“Seryosong alegasyon po ito na dapat nating tutukan (This is a serious allegation that we should look into),” he said. “But at this point, let us allow the investigation of the NBI to take its course at huwag po muna sana nating agad husgahan ang ating kapulisan (and we should not immediately judge our police officers).”

The two suspects alleged that as police assets, they pinpointed the location and identified the three kidnap victims as marijuana peddlers.

The supposed police assets also claimed they were with the policemen when they took the three men from their neighborhood in Sta. Cruz, Manila last April. They said the three men were already dead. (PNA)
