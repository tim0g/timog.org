**MANILA CITY** –  Malacañang on Thursday slammed the distribution of fliers in Pasay City claiming that Covid-19 vaccines being administered in certain areas are fake.

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque made this statement following reports that some individuals opted not to pursue their vaccination in SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City after receiving the said fliers.

“Kalokohan po ‘yan. Lahat po ng bakuna ligtas at epektibo (That’s nonsense. All vaccines are safe and effective),” he said in a Palace press briefing.

He warned fake news peddlers that they may face sanctions under the law.

“At yung mga nagpapakalat po ng ganyang mga fake news, titignan natin kung anong pupuwedeng gawin [sa] [ka]nila dahil tandaan niyo po we’re in a state of public emergency (And those who spread such fake news, we will see what they can do because remember we’re in a state of public emergency),” he added.

Persons who spread false news about the Covid-19 pandemic will face two-month imprisonment or a fine of up to PHP1 million, based on the Republic Act 11469 or Bayanihan to Heal as One Act (Bayanihan 1) inked by President Rodrigo Duterte on March 24, 2020.

To date, the Philippines has so far secured a total of 16,205,876 doses of Covid-19 vaccines with the arrival of 2 million additional Sinovac jabs on Thursday.

The country now has four brands of Covid-19 vaccines in its inventory namely Sinovac’s CoronaVac (China), AstraZeneca (UK), Sputnik V (Russia), and Pfizer (US).

Ready for Delta strain

Meanwhile, Roque assured that the government is prepared for a possible surge in Covid-19 cases caused by the possible entry of the Delta coronavirus variant (B1617) first discovered in India.

“We are doing what is necessary para po paghandaan ang pagpasok nitong mas nakakahawa at mas nakakamatay na Delta variant (to prepare for the possible entry of this more infectious and more deadly Delta variant),” Roque said.

He appealed to the public to continue observing minimum public health standards such as wearing of face masks, hand-washing, and physical distancing even after getting vaccinated against Covid-19.

“Magtulungan tayo, magkaisa dahil ibang klase po ‘tong bagong kalaban natin na Delta and Delta Plus variants (Let us help each other, unite, because this Delta and Delta Plus virus is a different kind of enemy),” he added.

A total of 17 Delta variant cases have been so far detected in the country, according to the Department of Health (DOH).

Reports showed that the Delta variant is found to be 60 percent more infectious than the Alpha variant and apparently behind the surge in cases in other countries. (PNA)
