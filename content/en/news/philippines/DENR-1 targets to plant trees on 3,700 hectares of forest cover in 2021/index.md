**SAN FERNANDO CITY ** – The Department of Environment and Natural Resources  in Ilocos (DENR-1) targets to plant trees on 3,700 hectares of forest cover in the region for this year.

The said target was reported during the Kapihan sa Ilocos program of the Philippine Information Agency-Region 1 on June 4 with DENR-1 as guest agency during the kick-off celebration of the 2021 Philippine Environment Month with the theme: “Sama-samang Pagkilos, Sama-samang Paghilom, Ikaw, Ako, Tayo ang Kalikasan.”

According to DENR-1 Assistant Regional Director for Technical Services and in-charge of the Office of the Regional Executive Director Felix  Taguba, “In compliance with Executive Order No. 26 or the National Greening Program (NGP), from 2011 to 2020, we were able to cover 91,841 hectares or equivalent to 80,000,847 seedlings planted.”Further, he said that with the aim of the NGP to plant 1.5 billion trees in 1.5 billion hectares of lands of public domain for a period of six years in the entire country, DENR-1 is implementing various programs to reach the target together with its partner agencies.

“Some of the NGPs objective is to reduce poverty in the upland areas, be able to provide food security to the people, for environmental stability and biodiversity conservation, and most importantly mitigation and adaptation to climate change,” Taguba added.

Taguba said that Executive Order No. 193 or Enhanced NGP, which was signed on November 12, 2015, will rehabilitate all the remaining unproductive, denuded and degraded forestlands estimated at 7.1 million hectares from the years 2016 up to 2028.

He expressed that through the support of DENR’s partners and the community, the said target is not impossible to reach.

The NGP, as the DENR’s banner program, is a convergence initiative with the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Agrarian Reform, where DENR stands as the lead agency.

Meanwhile, DENR Environmental Management Bureau Regional Director Engr. Ma. Dorica Naz-Hipe also reminded the local government units (LGUs) to comply with Republic Act (RA) 9003 or the Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 during the said program.

“It is fortunate that some of the LGUs in the Ilocos region, which have non-compliant dumpsites, have the initiative to voluntarily discontinue their operations and did not wait for a cease and decease order from our agency to act on the matter, since they already know that our agency is strictly implementing the law,” Hipe said.
