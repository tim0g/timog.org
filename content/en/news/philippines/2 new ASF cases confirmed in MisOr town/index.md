**CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY** â€“  The provincial veterinary office (ProVet) in Misamis Oriental on Monday confirmed two new positive cases of the African swine fever (ASF) in two villages in Manticao town.

The new cases found in Purok 10, Tuod village, and Sitio Mariposa, Cabalantian village came after two weeks of zero cases of ASF in those areas, according to ProVet chief Dr. Benjamin Resma.

"They are being affected again. We already detected cases (of ASF) before in the said areas, and now there are new cases," he said.

As of Monday, there are six municipalities and one city affected by ASF in the province, or a total of 44 villages.

Resma also said two areas each in Tagoloan and Villanueva and three areas in different villages in Balingasag town are under investigation.

The province is still prohibiting hog shipments without the required travel documents and those from ASF-affected areas outside the province.

"This is what we strictly monitor because there are a lot who want to deliver here because of the markets in Misamis Oriental and Cagayan de Oro," he said.

Disinfection is ongoing in all entry points, especially in the eastern part from Tagoloan to Magsaysay which remain green zones or ASF-free.

Livelihood programs

ProVet has assured livelihood programs for ASF-affected farmers.

Among the listed beneficiaries are 13 farmers from Opol town, 19 in Initao town, 28 in Libertad, and 15 in Manticao, who are currently undergoing project briefing.

The local governments of El Salvador City and Alubijid are also identifying project beneficiaries.

As of Monday, 670 farmers are affected by ASF in Misamis Oriental, with PHP3.570 million worth of cash assistance already released by the provincial government.

Resma urged ASF-affected farmers to visit their city and municipal agriculture offices for enrollment to the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC).

Starting next month, he said the PCIC will give double indemnification cash assistance of PHP10,000 from the previous PHP5,000.

"The DA (Department of Agriculture) will have until the end of the month to pay (indemnification). Next month, it will be the PCIC. Again, we are doubling the indemnification payout for every pig that contracts ASF," he added.

Enrollment to the PCIC is free. (PNA)
