**MANILA CITY** â€“  The recovery count among Filipinos with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) overseas is at 12,096, with 19 new survivors recorded over the past week, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) reported Saturday.

The active cases, on the other hand, are pegged at 7,108 while the death toll has reached 1,220.

Based on DFA's latest monitoring, at least 22 Filipinos abroad died of the disease while some 332 were infected from June 13 to June 19. The spike in the number of cases is due to an increase in reported infections in the Middle East/Africa region and the Asia Pacific on June 14 and June 18, respectively.

Of the fatalities this week, two came from the Americas while 19 were from the Middle East/Africa region.

In a statement, the agency said: "The DFA personnel in our Foreign Service Posts remain steadfast in partnering with local health authorities and commit to tirelessly attending to the needs of our people, whenever possible."

As of this posting, there are 4,426 Filipinos undergoing treatment in the Middle East/Africa region, 1,637 in the Asia Pacific, 930 in Europe, and 115 in the Americas. (PNA)
