**CITY OF SAN FERNANDO, Pampanga** –  Authorities arrested three suspected drug peddlers and seized almost PHP345,000 worth of illegal drugs during a buy-bust in Nueva Ecija on Wednesday.

In a statement on Thursday, Brig. Gen. Valeriano T. de Leon, director of the Police Regional Office 3, said the suspects were identified as Jonathan Fermin and Rolando Fermin, residents of Purok 4, Barangay Tagpos, Sta. Rosa town and Reden Paltao, of Purok 7, Barangay Bakal 1, Talavera town, both in Nueva Ecija.

De Leon said based on the report of Col. Jaime Santos, acting director of the Nueva Ecija Police Provincial Office, the suspects were arrested in Barangay Sta. Arcadia, Cabanatuan City.

Confiscated from the suspects were 10 heat sealed transparent plastic sachets of shabu weighing 50.7 grams with Dangerous Drug Board-estimated street value of PHP344,760.

The suspects will be charged with violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

"With the continuous arrest and neutralization of drug peddlers, the proliferation of illegal drugs and destruction of many lives are prevented,” de Leon said. (PNA)
