**MANILA CITY** – A leader of the House of Representatives on Tuesday welcomed the Development Budget Coordinating Committee's (DBCC) support for reforms to the military and uniformed personnel (MUP) pension system to make it more fiscally sustainable.

Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, chair of the House Ad hoc Committee on the MUP Pension System, said nothing is more authoritative than a clear statement from the country’s fiscal managers that such reforms are needed urgently as far as fiscal sustainability is concerned.

Citing the DBCC, Salceda highlighted that actual MUP pension spending has grown at an average rate of 12.3 percent from 2010 to 2019, which, he said, is "too fast for our fiscal resources" to accommodate without reform.

"The situation could further be exacerbated by the growth in MUP salaries. The DBCC is right to emphasize that maintaining automatic indexation of pensions to salaries of active personnel is also a significant threat to the sustainability of the pension system," he said.

He said the MUP salaries have grown at an average of 19.63 percent from 2008 to 2019 based on DBCC data.

"We are between a rock and a hard place with this situation. On the one hand, we want to recognize the difficulties of being an MUP. On the other hand, we don’t want to lie to them and say that we can always afford the current pension system," he said.

He argued that at current levels and growth rates, this situation will "explode" in the future.

"I will not be able to stomach doing nothing now, as the threat in the future is real that we may be unable to pay pensions or raise salaries someday unless we enact urgent reforms," he said.

He said the House leadership is committed to getting a version of this reform approved. "The choice is between some pain now, or plenty of pain in the future. The DBCC statement today makes that clear."

Last week, the House Ad hoc Committee on the MUP Pension System approved the unnumbered substitute bill after significant issues were resolved among the committee members and with the military and uniformed services branches.

Among the key revisions in the bill include the addition of disability benefits in the authorized insurance system and the creation of a provident fund to be infused with voluntary contributions from MUPs.

The disability benefits shall be created under the risk insurance system to enhance the benefits package for MUPs who incur disabilities in the line of duty.

“The benefits that MUPs will receive from the insurance system [are what] we will create under the Trust Fund Committee. [This] will be on top of whatever benefits they are already entitled to. So, this is a way to balance our fiscal reform of the system with the unique risks the MUPs take,” Salceda said.

The bill also provides a harmonized definition for what constitutes an MUP member.

He said law enforcement agencies such as the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency should be included in the definition of uniformed services.

Other features of the bill include the removal of automatic indexation but retention of the no-contribution scheme, pension increases based on a cost-of-living adjustment, rationalizing pensionable age at 56 years old, and allowing optional retirement at 20 years.

Also proposed are higher risk insurance coverage for those wounded or killed in action, and the creation of a military and uniformed services trust fund, with leeway to initiate a credible defense posture. (PNA)
