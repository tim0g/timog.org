**MANILA CITY** –  The construction of the PHP3.39 billion Binondo-Intramuros Bridge funded by China is now 70 percent complete, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) said on Tuesday.

Emil Sadain, undersecretary for Unified Project Management Office (UPMO) Operations, said the civil work activities for the ramps and viaduct structure are underway as they aim for the bridge's substantial completion by December 2021.

The iconic bridge will connect the historic districts of Binondo and Intramuros in Manila, having a 418-meter viaduct structure and ramp over Estero de Binondo and 298-m Binondo up-ramp on Muelle Dela Industria Street at Binondo side, and 191-m up-ramp at Magallanes/Riverside Drive and 164-m down ramp on Solana Street in Intramuros.

The bridge will carry extra traffic of around 30,000 vehicles per day and will also help extend the life of existing Jones, Delpan, and MacArthur Bridges by decongesting traffic.

Sadain, who inspected the project on Tuesday, said the project has attained 70 percent completion with the 70-m main bridge with steel arch and support steel bowstring over Pasig River permanently positioned at piers 4 and 5, and installation of pre-fabricated precast slab available on-site will soon start.

He added that the fabricated steel box girders which will be utilized for the viaduct and ramp over Estero de Binondo are expected to arrive from China by August 2021.

Bored piles for the up/down ramps and abutments at Intramuros side are all completed while works are in full swing for the 98 bored piles at Binondo side, 61 of which are completed.

The DPWH and the contractor continue to coordinate with Meralco and Telco for their lines along Dasmariñas Bridge and as strategies are formulated to minimize service disruption with the launching of steel box girders along Estero de Binondo towards Plaza del Conde and Rentas Street and the relocation of affected lines along Muelle de Binondo near San Nicolas Fire Station.

The project is part of the Metro Manila Logistics Improvement Program to address the long-held dilemma of traffic gridlock in major roads by constructing new bridges crossing Pasig and Marikina Rivers, and Manggahan Floodway.

Also present during the inspection were UPMO Roads Management Cluster 1 - Bilateral OIC-Project Director Benjamin A. Bautista, Project Manager Melchor Kabiling, Project Engineer Joey Doria, and contractor China Road and Bridge Corporation.

Funded by a grant from the People’s Republic of China, the arch bridge design symbolizes the friendly cooperation between the Philippines and China and being built in accordance with new seismic design specifications and climate change considerations. (PNA)
