**CAMP SK PENDATUN, Maguindanao** – Three persons were killed and another was injured in a Sunday afternoon ambush triggered by a long-standing “rido” (family feud) involving Muslim families in Balabagan, Lanao del Sur.

Maj. Marlon Silvestre, Balabagan town police chief, identified the fatalities as Mando Interino and militiamen Hanafi Baraguer, and Venhar Macapodi, all residents of Barangay Tubok, Malabang, Lanao del Sur.

“All three victims died on the spot,” Silvestre told reporters here Monday.

Injured was Mastor Gani of Barangay Barurao, Balabagan Lanao Del Sur, who was hit by a stray bullet and is now recuperating in the town’s hospital.

The victims were onboard separate motorcycles heading from Balabagan to nearby Malabang town when gunmen ambushed them around 4 p.m. in Barangay Molimok, Balabagan town.

"Witnesses said the gunmen quickly boarded a multi-cab vehicle and sped off after the incident,” Silvestre said.

Responding policemen found empty shells for Galil rifle, M16 rifle, and .45-caliber pistol at the crime scene.

Silvestre said efforts by both local and religious leaders are underway to defuse tension in Balabagan and nearby Malabang and prevent escalation of hostilities. (PNA)
