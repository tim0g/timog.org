**MANILA CITY** – The nation’s total number of recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases has climbed to 1,277,715 after 7,652 new recoveries were reported on Sunday.
 
In its latest case bulletin, the Department of Health (DOH) said recoveries account for 94 percent of the total case count which has reached 1,359,015 since the start of the pandemic last year.
 
The agency also reported 5,803 new cases, bringing the total number of active cases to 57,679.
 
About 91.9 percent of these active cases are mild, 2.7 percent are asymptomatic, 1.3 percent are critical, 1.8 percent are severe, and 1.29 percent are moderate.
 
Some 84 new deaths were also reported, pushing the country’s total number of Covid-19 fatalities to 23,621.
 
According to DOH data on June 18, about 13.2 percent of 48,073 who were tested turned out positive for Covid-19.
 
"There were eight duplicates that have been removed from the total case count, and of these, six were recovered cases. Moreover, 115 cases previously reported to be recoveries have been validated to be active cases, and 59 cases that were previously tagged as recoveries were reclassified as deaths after final validation," the DOH said.
 
On June 18, two laboratories were not able to submit their data to the Covid-19 Document Repository System (CDRS).
 
The DOH said six non-reporting laboratories contribute on average 0.14 percent of samples tested, and 0.13 percent of positive individuals based on data in the last 14 days.
 
To date, 57 percent of 3,500 intensive care unit beds, 47 percent of 19,100 isolation beds, 46 percent of 12,500 ward beds, and 36 percent of 2,700 ventilators are utilized by patients with Covid-19 nationwide.
