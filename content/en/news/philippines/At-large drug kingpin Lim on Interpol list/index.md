**MANILA CITY** –  Fugitive Peter Go Lim, wanted for illegal drug trafficking, has been on the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) list of fugitives at-large for more than two years now.

According to the Philippine Center for Transnational Crime, Lim has been included in the Interpol’s Red Notice list since March 2019.

“Still no information on his whereabouts,” Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Menardo Guevarra told reporters on Tuesday.

Guevarra said they are hoping Interpol assistance, along with intensified intelligence operations, would finally locate Lim, who went missing in 2018 after the Makati City Regional Trial Court Branch 65 issued a warrant for his arrest and a hold departure order.

The Bureau of Immigration (BI) earlier said Lim has no recent departure records.

BI spokesperson Dana Sandoval said records would bare if Lim had left via airports or seaports.

“If he used a fraudulent passport, then our equipment would be able to detect it,” she said in a statement after Local Government Secretary Eduardo Año said in a recent radio interview that Lim may already be out of the country.

The DOJ also filed two counts of the non-bailable offense of conspiracy to commit illegal drug trade against Lim, in violation of Republic Act No. 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

Self-confessed drug lord Rolando “Kerwin” Espinosa and his associate Marcelo Adorco were likewise charged, along with Ruel Malindangan who also went into hiding. (PNA)
