**DAVAO CITY** –  A total of 226 cities and municipalities now have online booking for the Step 2 registration of the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys).

The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) announced the available online booking sites as of June 12, up from 14 pilot cities and municipalities on May 24.

Appointment schedules for Step 2 can be made online through https://register.philsys.gov.ph.

Step 2 must be done personally as it involves fingerprint and iris scans and taking of front-facing photographs.

The PSA also reminded those who have finished Step 1 through face-to-face or house-to-house demographic data collection that they no longer need to register and book an appointment online.

“The PSA or your respective local government units will provide you with updates for the schedule of your Step 2 registration,” it said.

For inquiries, the PhilSys Registry Office can be reached via hotline number 1388 or email address info@philsys.gov.ph.

A total of 10,092,022 have finished Step 2 registration, according to the May 24 update of PhilSys.

Signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte in August 2018, Republic Act 11055, or the Philippine Identification System Act, aims to establish a single national ID for all Filipinos and resident aliens.

The national ID shall be a valid proof of identity that shall be a means of simplifying public and private transactions, enrollment in schools, and the opening of bank accounts.

It will also boost efficiency, especially in dealing with government services where people will only need to present one ID during transactions. (PNA)
