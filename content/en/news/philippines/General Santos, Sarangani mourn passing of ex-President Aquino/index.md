**GENERAL SANTOS CITY** –  The city government joined the nation in mourning the passing of former President Benigno Simeon Aquino III on Thursday morning.

The Philippine flags at the city hall complex here were flown at half-mast as directed by Mayor Ronnel Rivera following the confirmation of the former President’s death.

“The local government unit and the residents of General Santos City are one with the whole country as we mourn the death and celebrate the life of the late President,” the city government said in a statement.

It offered heartfelt condolences and prayers to the bereaved friends and family of the former President, who visited the city several times to inaugurate various projects during his term from 2010 to 2016.

“Today, we remember his service to the Filipinos and the rest of the country,” it said.

In Sarangani, lone district representative and deputy speaker Rogelio Pacquiao expressed “profound sadness” with Aquino’s passing.

"On behalf of all Saranganis, my family and I extend our deepest condolences and heartfelt prayers to his bereaved family,” he said in a Facebook post.

Pacquiao described the late President as a devoted public servant and contributed greatly to the development of the country.

“I salute his extraordinary life and remarkable contributions in the pursuit of democracy and progress. May his legacy remains an inspiration for us all and may his soul rest in eternal peace," he said. (PNA)
