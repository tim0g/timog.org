**LAOAG CITY** –   When Elizsa Gayle Cafirma, 30, together with her younger siblings Elize, 23, and Edel, 27, decided to plunge into business, they know well that it will be going to be a tough ride. But having each other's back, the journey could be an adventure of a lifetime.

Sharing the same interest in food and cooking, the Cafirma sisters who are all degree holders with NC II certificates in Bread and Pastry established their own "Thick and Thin" cafe strategically located near the Bacarra National Comprehensive High School in their hometown of Bacarra, Ilocos Norte.

Established in 2016, Thick and Thin cafe specializes in doughnuts, targeting millennials as customers. They also have a selection of healthy bread and pastries which they can customize upon request.

Elizsa is a graduate of Entrepreneurship at the Saint Louis University (SLU) in Baguio City and a licensed teacher.

Before she made up her mind to go full-time in business with the help of her sisters who are also graduates in Human Resource Management and Psychology at SLU, the eldest Cafirma sibling narrated she first worked at the Sarrat National High School but only served there for four years.

She said her first love, which is business, prevailed over teaching.

Her sisters likewise followed suit. Hence, the birth of another Thick and Thin baby, which recently opened at the government-owned La Tabacalera Food Park in this city.

As part of the economic recovery plan of the Ilocos Norte government, Governor Matthew Joseph Manotoc initiated the launching of the open food park beside the Ilocos Norte Capitol, inviting promising small businesses like Thick and Thin to reach out to more customers in the new normal.

With a total of 10 staff and supportive parents backing the Cafirma sisters who are apparently enjoying making doughnuts to satisfy their growing customers, Elizsa said they will continue to improve and recalibrate their baking skills as they aspire to establish more branches in the province and even expand more in the future.

When asked what makes their business afloat amid a worldwide pandemic, Elizsa said it is in loving what they do that makes the rollercoaster ride with her sisters totally worth it.

And as they started young in the business, Elizsa said that they can outgrow all the challenges that come along in running a business.

"Our customers are at the heart of what we do. Without you, we would cease to exist. It will always be a pleasure to serve you,” she added. (PNA)
