**MANILA CITY** â€“ The United Kingdom will continue working with the Philippines to tackle climate change and promote biodiversity conservation, British Ambassador to Manila Daniel Pruce said Wednesday.

Pruce made the statement during a virtual roundtable discussion ahead of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) which will be hosted by the UK in Glasgow from November 1 to 12.

"The UK is committed to tackling climate change and contributing to the achievements of countries (on this area). In the Philippines we convened the first Climate Change and Environment dialogue, a key pillar on the enhanced partnership between us two countries," he said.

Pruce said this mechanism serves as an "important framework" to open up new areas of cooperation between the two nations.

The diplomat said the two countries in the past also had a lot of projects to conserve mangrove forests, protect tamaraws in Mindoro as well as joint programs between Filipino and British researchers focused on climate talks and sustainability.

"So these go on, these are few illustrations of the types of work we're doing here to support the country in achieving the high-level ambitions we've set ourselves in COP26," he said.

The COP26 summit in November will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

"Under the UK's Presidency of COP26, in partnership with Italy, we have set out four goals for our Presidency aimed to accelerate this real-world progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement aims: mitigation, adaptation, finance, and collaboration," Pruce said. (PNA)
