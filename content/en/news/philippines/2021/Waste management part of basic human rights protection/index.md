**MANILA CITY** – Waste management shows how a country values human dignity as the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on Tuesday recognized improved efforts in time for the observance of Philippine Environment Month in July.

The CHR likewise lauded the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) order to close down some 335 open dumpsites nationwide.

In a statement, CHR spokesperson Jacqueline de Guia said waste management efforts will not only improve environmental sustainability and health outcomes but will surely contribute to the full enjoyment of basic human rights.

"While national and local interventions during the pandemic are largely focused on protecting lives and economies, management of waste is also essential to minimize long-term risks to human and environmental health," she said.

In shutting down open dumpsites, the DENR enforced Republic Act (RA) No. 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, which provides the necessary policy framework, institutional mechanisms, and mandate for local government units (LGUs) to achieve 25-percent waste reduction through the establishment of an integrated solid waste management plans based on 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycling).

De Guia said environmental degradation can lead to "very serious and continuing violations of our human rights".

"People’s health, food and water safety, housing, and overall well-being can be negatively affected by improper disposal of waste and hazardous materials," she added.

Hazardous dumpsites

Among the health and environmental risks of illegal dumpsites are the contamination of soil and water, increased risks of natural disasters and health issues, and disruption of wildlife, the CHR said.

"Unlike sanitary landfills, illegal dumpsites do not have built-in systems and constant monitoring for environmental safety," she said.

RA No. 9003 specifically bans the use of open dumpsites for solid waste by any person, including LGUs.

"We commend that appropriate cases have been filed by the DENR against public officials who have not fully complied with the law in their capacity as heads of LGUs," de Guia said.

Waste management requires integrated assessments and holistic approaches for its solution, she added.

"While we support the successful efforts of LGUs in their crafting and implementation of their own local solid waste management plan, detailing their framework for reusing, recycling, and composting waste in their jurisdiction, we emphasize that waste disposal system has to be simple and accessible for common people for it to work," de Guia said.

The CHR likewise called for stricter monitoring of LGUs’ compliance with the National Solid Waste Management Commission’s Resolution No. 1364 or the Interim Guidelines on the Management of Covid-19 Related Health Care Waste, noting an increase in medical and personal protective equipment wastes.

"Due to the pandemic, the collection of waste from certain locations such as quarantine facilities, lockdown areas, and isolation centers pose a different set of hazards to local communities since they may be potentially infected with the coronavirus," de Guia said.

"With or without the pandemic, the CHR underscores that from national to household levels, there is an urgent call for waste management to be treated as essential public service," she added. (PNA)
