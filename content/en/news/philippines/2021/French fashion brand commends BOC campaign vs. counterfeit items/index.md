**MANILA CITY** –  The Bureau of Customs (BOC) has been recognized by luxury brand Louis Vuitton (LV) for its campaign against counterfeit items.

Commissioner Rey Leonardo Guerrero received a plaque of recognition from the French fashion firm brand on Monday.

“On behalf of Louis Vuitton, we would like to express our sincere appreciation to you, Commissioner Guerrero as well as the Enforcement & Security Service group for continuously striving for excellence and being committed to carrying out your duties in upholding the intellectual priority laws and preventing the general sales and distribution of counterfeit LV products in the Philippines,” said the plaque which was signed by Mayank Vaid, LV intellectual property director for Asia Pacific & China (Civil).

“We particularly congratulate you for the leadership, proactiveness, and professionalism in the raids conducted in 2020-2021 against the stockists and sellers of goods with forged Louis Vuitton trademarks,” Vaid added.

Guerrero thanked the famous international brand for the recognition given to the efforts brought forth by the bureau.

He acknowledged the representatives of Louis Vuitton for their continued support in the bureau’s drive against prohibited goods.

Meanwhile, an estimated PHP 2.1 billion counterfeit goods were seized for the year 2021, through the combined efforts of BOC Enforcement Group’s Enforcement and Security Service (EG-ESS) and Intelligence Group’s Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service (IG-CIIS).

Louis Vuitton Malletier is a French fashion house and luxury goods company founded in 1854.

The company manufacturers high-end bags, belts, shoes, and other fashion items.

The brand is a common victim of counterfeit items that are illegally imported into the country. (PNA)
