**MANILA CITY** – The Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) of South Korea and the Department of Agriculture (DA) have collaborated on a study to improve the Philippines’ swine industry through a USD1.2-million project.

The “Feasibility Study on Enhancing Meat Safety and Quality through Establishment of Modern Livestock Infrastructure and Inspection Facilities with Traceability Systems" is “important, critical, urgent, timely and high impact that if successfully implemented will benefit livestock industry," DA Secretary William Dar said in a statement on Monday.

The result of the study was released by the EDCF, a subsidiary of the Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM Bank) which is the official export credit agency of South Korea.

The EDCF feasibility study was based on five components: installation of new inspection equipment; establishment of modern livestock facilities with global standard meat complex in Regions 3 (Central Luzon) or 4-A (Calabarzon); development and implementation of information and communications technology system; capacity-building; and policy recommendation.

Under the project, a meat enhancement facility is eyed to rise in 2023 in Calabarzon, one of the regions where structures for the improvement of the swine industry will be constructed.

In a recent regional briefing, Jonathan Sabiniano Sr. Technical and Planning Officer of the Office of the Undersecretary for Livestock, shared that the facility will have a slaughterhouse, storage facility, meat cutting, and packaging facilities, carcass auction market wholesaling space, and chilling and freezing warehouses.

The study will also pave the way for the construction of a Meat Academy, a Philippine training center for meat slaughtering and processing; a 50-ton capacity feed mill; and the upgrade of the Regional Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and National Meat Inspection System (NMIS) laboratory.

Sabiniano said Calabarzon, particularly Batangas, National Capital Region, and Regions 3, 7, and 11 are prospect sites for developments.

KEXIM-EDCF will donate seaport container scanners with interpretation room for the international container terminals in Batangas.

In 2018, the DA-Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) and NMIS also signed a deal with KEXIM Bank to strengthen the livestock industry with the vision of food security and possible export potential. (PNA)
