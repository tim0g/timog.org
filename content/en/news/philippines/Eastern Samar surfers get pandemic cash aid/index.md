**TACLOBAN CITY** –  About 80 members of Surfriders Club of Eastern Samar (SCES) have received cash assistance meant for tourism workers displaced by the coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic.
 
The beneficiaries who got PHP5,000 cash each starting last week are surfers from Borongan City, Maydolong, Taft, and Llorente town.
 
“We thank the DOT (Department of Tourism) regional office in Eastern Visayas for helping us with the process in applying for this program. We would also like to extend our thanks to DOLE (Department of Labor and Employment) for expediting the release of the fund so that the recipients can make use of the aid while the capital city is under more strict movement restrictions,” SCES president Rupert Ambil said in a phone interview Monday.
 
The program was initiated by the DOT and DOLE funded under Bayanihan to Recover as One Act.
 
Ambil also reminded recipients to make use of the financial assistance productively to ease the economic effects of this pandemic.
 
Since last year, the group has produced and distributed face shields to the medical workers and residents.
 
In February this year, the group also distributed new PHP150,000 worth of surf boards to six aspiring young surfers in Borongan City.
 
The group was also instrumental in organizing the Surf in the City Festival event in 2019 in partnership with the city government, and the Philippine Surfing Championship Tour participated by nearly 100 surfers from different parts of the country. (PNA)
