**MANILA CITY** –  Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año on Monday lauded government units (LGUs) for using creative ways to convince the public to get vaccinated against the coronavirus.

Though more of the population becomes eligible for the vaccination, some are still hesitant to get the life-saving shot, prompting LGUs to provide discounts and freebies for the vaccinated.

In his report to President Rodrigo Duterte Monday night, Año cited as an example the raffle scheme of Las Piñas Rep. Camille Villar where vaccinated persons have a chance to win motorcycles and a brand new house and lot.

“Ganoon din po sa Santa, Ilocos Sur sa inisyatibo ni Mayor Jesus Bueno Jr. ay puwedeng manalo rin ng isang house and lot (This is the same case in Santa, Ilocos Sur where Mayor Jesus Bueno Jr. through his initiative gave the chance to vaccinated persons to win a house and lot),’’ Año added.

Some businesses are also offering perks such as discounts and freebies to vaccinated customers with the aim to attract and convince people to get the jab.

Health experts say vaccines remain the best weapon against Covid-19, especially this time when the more transmissible Delta variant is spreading in many countries.

Año said based on the latest data from the vaccination monitoring system, about 33,349,622 individuals have registered for vaccination. (PNA)
