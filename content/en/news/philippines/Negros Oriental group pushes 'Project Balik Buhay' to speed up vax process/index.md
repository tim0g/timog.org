**DUMAGUETE CITY** –  The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Association of Dumaguete and Negros Oriental is pushing for the establishment of "Project Balik Buhay" (PBB) to speed up the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccination process.

The PBB is a public-private partnership of the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV), the National Task Force Covid-19 in the Visayas, and the Department of Health in Region 7 (DOH-7) to “assist the government’s national vaccination program”.

In a Zoom lecture Friday afternoon initiated by the association of ICT firms and business process outsourcing (BPO) companies, guest lecturer Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, chief pathologist of the DOH-7, said the PBB is a big help in ensuring the smooth flow of the vaccination activities as well as other concerns relative to the process.

“You don’t have that in Negros Oriental, unlike here in Cebu, but you should establish one because it would help when you submit your priority master-list, it will help in your prioritization,” she said in mixed English and Cebuano.

While the online activity focused on Loreche’s lecture on vaccines, their effects, and the government’s deployment plan, the ICT Association of Dumaguete and Negros Oriental also had the chance to follow up on its request to be given priority in the vaccination rollout.

Suzanne Lu-Bascara, association president and assistant vice president, reiterated the promise of Gov. Roel Degamo last month that they would be given priority in the vaccination rollout.

Signifying their intent on the establishment of the PBB, Loreche told them they could write a letter request for inclusion of their companies in Project Balik Buhay.

There are an estimated 12,000 ICT-BPO employees in Dumaguete City and Negros Oriental.

Joslyn Andreai Hartzell, director for Community Relations of Qualfon, Inc., and moderator of the online event, said many Dumagueteños are actually interested in the PBB.

On its website, the PBB said “the program is free of charge and aside from the vaccines and medical personnel to be provided by the DOH, all operating expenses incurred in these PBB Private Sector Vaccination Centers will be shouldered and donated by the private sector, at no cost to the government nor to the Cebuanos availing of their services.” (PNA)
