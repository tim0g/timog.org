**MANILA CITY** –  House Deputy Speaker Rufus Rodriguez on Tuesday asked the Department of Health (DOH) to send 24 ventilators to various hospitals in Cagayan de Oro City amid the mounting coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the area.

Rodriguez made the request for additional ventilators in a letter addressed to Health Secretary Francisco Duque lll, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, as well as the field implementation and coordination team of Visayas and Mindanao headed by DOH Undersecretary Abdullah Dumama Jr., and DOH Director Ma. Soledad Antonio, as the Covid-19 cases soar to 10,107 in the city as of Sunday.

“The hospitals in the city are still seeing an influx of Covid-19 patients, with some forced to wait in line for vacancy. The healthcare utilization rate is at 74.56 percent,” he said.

Rodriguez asked for ventilators for the following hospitals: 10 units for Northern Mindanao Medical Center; three units for J. R. Borja General Hospital; three units for Maria Reyna - Xavier University Hospital; two units for Capitol University Medical Center; two units for Cagayan de Oro Polymedic Medical Plaza; two units for Cagayan de Oro Medical Center/Oncology Cancer; and two units for Madonna and Child Hospital.

He said the ventilators he requested can be sourced from the remaining 63 units that the DOH has announced were on standby and ready to be deployed to the regions.

“The DOH has to help our hospitals treat Covid-19 patients especially now that there is a so-called Delta or Indian variant that is more contagious than the UK variant,” he said.

He said from June 14-20, there were 563 new infected persons, 37 of whom were admitted to hospitals, while the others were outpatients, adding 17 individuals died of Covid-19 during the same period.

Rodriguez earlier pointed out that the national government has neglected Mindanao in its Covid-19 response, particularly the vaccine distribution in the region.

During a briefing of the House Committee on Mindanao Affairs, Rodriguez hit vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. for his supposed lack of priority in addressing the uptick in Covid-19 cases in Mindanao, as his letter of request for additional supply of Covid-19 vaccines for his constituents in Cagayan de Oro and other parts of the region was ignored.

Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, however, said the government has been pushing for an equitable distribution of the Covid-19 jabs nationwide.

Roque said the government has prioritized areas classified as having high cases of Covid-19 in the distribution of vaccines.

He highlighted that around 38 percent of the country's vaccine supply was distributed to Metro Manila and surrounding areas, adding that the remaining balance will be delivered to the rest of the Philippines.

Roque attributed the surge in coronavirus infections to low compliance with health protocols in parts of Visayas and Mindanao.

He also noted that stricter quarantine classifications, such as the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) and modified ECQ (MECQ), were not implemented in these areas with Covid-19 case spikes.

"Mayroon pong mga datos na nagpapakita na kaya din nag-surge po sa ilang parte ng Pilipinas - sa Visayas and Mindanao, eh kasi hindi nag-ECQ, hindi nag-MECQ. At talagang bumaba po ang compliance with the minimum health protocols (There are also data showing why cases surged in other parts of the Philippines – in Visayas and Mindanao, is because of non-implementation of ECQ and MECQ. And compliance with the minimum health protocols also dropped)," he said. (PNA)
