**MANILA CITY** –  The OCTA Research Group on Friday said the National Capital Region’s (NCR) average number of new coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases per day over the past seven days has declined to 758.

Its latest monitoring report showed the figure accounts for an 18 percent decrease for the period of June 11 to 17 compared to the previous week.

From June 4 to 10, NCR’s average of new Covid-19 cases per day is 924.

“This corresponds to an average daily attack rate (ADAR) of 5.49 per 100,000, which classifies it as moderate risk,” OCTA said.

NCR’s reproduction number over the same period was 0.71.

Its positivity rate was 7 percent with 35 percent hospital bed occupancy, 46 percent intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy, and 31 percent mechanical ventilator occupancy.

The group also reported that six local government units in the region had an ADAR below 5 – classifying them as moderate-low risk.

These include Malabon, Navotas, Caloocan, Marikina, Manila, and Quezon City.

Pateros, Navotas, Malabon, and San Juan had the lowest number of new cases per day over the past week with less than 20 new cases per day.

In terms of healthcare utilization rates, Pateros logged above 70 percent hospital bed utilization.

Meanwhile, Parañaque and San Juan had an ICU bed utilization rate higher than 70 percent. (PNA)
