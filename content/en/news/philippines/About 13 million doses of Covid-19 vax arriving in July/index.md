**MANILA CITY** â€“  About 13 million doses of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines will be delivered to the Philippines in July, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. bared during the weekly situation briefing with President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday.

Galvez, the Chief Implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19, said expected for delivery are 5.5 million doses of Sinovac and 1.17 million doses of AstraZeneca within the first two weeks next month.

On July 12, a total of 250,800 doses of Moderna and 500,000 doses of Pfizer may also arrive.

The country may also receive next month between 2 and 4 million doses from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility, 800,000 to 1 million doses donated by the United States government, and 1.1 million doses from the Japanese government.

Galvez said the US government's donation will most likely be the single-dose jabs by Johnson & Johnson.

This June alone, the Philippines received 9,126,420 vaccine doses -- 6.5 million doses of Sinovac; 100,000 doses of Sputnik V; 2,276,820 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech delivered through the COVAX facility; and 249,600 doses of Moderna, the first batch of the other US-made vaccine.

In August, Galvez said the government anticipates about 13,670,000 doses from Sinovac, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and the COVAX facility. (PNA)
