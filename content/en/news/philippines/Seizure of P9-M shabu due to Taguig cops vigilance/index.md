**MANILA CITY** –  Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Gen. Guillermo Eleazar on Tuesday attributed the arrest of two drug suspects with PHP9 million worth of suspected methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu to police vigilance as he lauded the Taguig City cops for a job well done.

“I commend the Taguig City Police for confiscating and removing this huge volume of illegal drugs from the streets. Nakita ko rin na ginagawa nila ang kanilang tungkulin sa pagroronda na nagbunga sa pagkakaaresto ng dalawang suspek (I also saw that they were doing their patrols that resulted in the arrest of the two suspects),” Eleazar said in a statement.

Eleazar said the Taguig City Police Station 6 personnel were conducting Oplan Galugad when they spotted Jemboy Pascual and Eskak Kamsa who were not wearing face masks in Purok 2, Maguindanao St. in Barangay New Lower Bicutan, Taguig.

When the policemen reminded them to wear face masks, the two suddenly ran away to the surprise of the police personnel who chased them.

The cops were able to catch Pascual and Kamsa and later found out that the two had ran away as they were carrying 27 pieces of heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets containing over 1.35 kilograms of suspected shabu with street value of PHP9.18 million.

They also had with them PHP10,000 cash and a weighing scale.

Eleazar said police authorities will not stop until all notorious drug personalities are apprehended throughout the country.

Maj. Gen. Vicente Danao Jr., National Police Region Police Office chief, also commended the Southern Police District under Brig. Gen. Jimili Macaraeg and the Taguig City cops.

“Malaking bagay ang pagkakahuli sa mga suspek na ito lalo pa at nahulihan sila ng malaking halaga ng hinihinalang shabu. Makakatulong ito upang matunton ng ating mga kapulisan ang iba pa kanilang mga kasama na maaaring magturo kung sino at saan nagmumula ang mga drogang ito (the arrest of these suspects was a big deal especially and they were caught with large amounts of suspected shabu. This will help our police track down the rest of their companions who can point out who and where the drugs come from)," Danao said in a separate statement.

Danao said Pascual and Kamsa will be charged with violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 in the City Prosecutor’s Office. (PNA)
