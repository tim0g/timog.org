**MANILA CITY** –  The 450th anniversary celebration of “Araw ng Maynila” (Manila Day) on Thursday was made more significant with the arrival of 400,000 doses of city-procured Sinovac Covid-19 vaccines.

The shipment was included in the two million doses which arrived at the Ninoy Aquino Terminal Airport, with the other 1.6 million bought by the national government.

Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso and Vice Mayor Dr. Honey Lacuna-Pangann joined National Task Force Against Covid-19 Chief Implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III in the welcome ceremony.

Officials from Sinovac Philippine distributor, IP-Biotech, Inc., were also present.

The Manila City Council raised PHP298.5 million for the Sinovac purchase, made through a tripartite deal with the national government and with assistance of Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian.

“Your city will continue to vaccinate as many as possible, as soon as possible. Our partnership with IP-Biotech and other local businesses will help us reach herd immunity in no time. More jabs will also create more jobs that will contribute to economic recovery,” Domagoso said in a previous interview.

Domagoso said they also ordered 800,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines in January but the delivery may be in September yet.

Manila had already vaccinated about 41 percent of the city’s 800,000 target population.

On Tuesday, the Manila Health Department reported 35,572 received jabs, a one-day record. (PNA)
