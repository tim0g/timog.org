**MANILA CITY** –  Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Gen. Guillermo Eleazar on Thursday commended police officers in the province of Biliran and La Union for their good deeds beyond their duty and exemplifying the spirit of “bayanihan” (civic unity) throughout the country.

Eleazar praised the police officers Lt. Alberto Parena and Cpl. Eladio Francisco II of the Naval Municipal Police in Biliran for donating blood to a woman who urgently needed a transfusion after undergoing surgery.

“Sa kabila ng mga isyu sa ating organisasyon, itong sina Lieutenant Parena at Corporal Francisco ang patunay na maraming matino sa ating hanay na handang tumugon sa panahon ng pangangailangan (Despite the issues in our organization, Lieutenant Parena and Corporal Francisco are proof that there are many good police officers in our ranks who are ready to respond in times of need.),” Eleazar said in a statement.

According to the Police Community Affairs and Development Group in Eastern Visayas, Jesel Vismanos Lumontod sought assistance for his mother who needed blood transfusion on June 15.

Parena and Francisco immediately responded and proceeded to the Biliran Provincial Hospital to donate blood.

Eleazar urged other policemen to emulate the two policemen’s display of unconditional and genuine service.

Meanwhile, policemen in Pugo, La Union have been giving free haircuts as a community service to people who are unable to go to barbershops amid the continuing threat of Covid-19.

From giving free haircuts to just 15 boys in Barangay Palina, the policemen of Pugo Municipal Police Station decided to expand their clientele and launched early this month a “Kuya Pulis Barbero” program.

Eleazar hailed the cops for this initiative which he said could help bring children closer to policemen and encourage them to emulate the good deeds of the police officers.

“Labis na nakatutuwa dahil kahit hindi man po kasama sa training ng ating mga pulis ang manggupit ng buhok, sinikap nila pag-aralan ang pagiging barbero para tulungan ang mga kabataan na kailangan nang magpagupit ng buhok (It is very inspiring because even though our police training does not include giving a haircut, they tried to learn how to be a barber to help young people who need to get a haircut),” Eleazar said.

Eleazar encouraged other police stations and units to think of more ways to provide public service.

“Hindi lang sa pagbabantay at pagpapanatili ng kaayusan sa ating mga komunidad natatapos ang ating sinumpaang tungkulin. Marami pa tayong magagawa para sa ating mga kababayan (Our sworn duty does not end only by guarding and maintaining order in our communities. We can still do a lot for our countrymen),” he added.
