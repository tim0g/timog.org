**MANILA CITY** –  The Bureau of Customs (BOC) Port of NAIA (Ninoy Aquino International Airport) had so far processed 20 shipments of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines.

Based on records released Saturday, freights with nearly 13 million doses of vaccines have been released as of June 18, 2021.

The vaccines were from manufacturers in China (Sinovac), Russia (Sputnik V), United Kingdom (AstraZeneca), and the United States (Pfizer-BioNTech).

BOC-NAIA also cleared 10,000 shipments of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies, representing 60 percent of total importations.

On the other hand, BOC-Davao facilitated the clearance of 210,000 Pfizer vaccines that arrived at the Davao International Airport on June 10 and 11.

The arrival was witnessed by officials of the Department of Health (DOH) Davao Region, City Mayor’s Office, Regional Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Disease XI, Regional Task Force Against Covid-19, and the City Health Office.

The vaccines were immediately loaded to refrigerator vans and transported to the DOH cold storage at Southern Philippines Medical Center.

The port had long prepared for the direct importation of vaccines in Mindanao. (PNA)
