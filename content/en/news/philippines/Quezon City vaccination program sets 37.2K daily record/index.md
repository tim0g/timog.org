**MANILA CITY** –  The Quezon City government has posted a daily vaccination high of over 37,000 doses administered against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) on Monday.

Mayor Joy Belmonte attributes the success of the city’s vaccination program, which is strictly by appointment, to their dedicated doctors, health care workers, staff, and volunteers.

“Bagong record! Umabot sa 37,234 doses ang bakunang naturok kahapon, ang pinakamataas na single-day record ng ating QCProtekTODO Vaccination Program (New record! 37,234 individuals were vaccinated yesterday, the highest single-day record in our QCProtekTODO Vaccination Program),” the local government posted on its Facebook page on Tuesday.

“Through our concerted effort, we will achieve our goal of population protection in our city,” Belmonte added in a statement.

The record was achieved among the city’s 41 vaccination sites.

So far, 495,490 individuals, or 29.1 percent of the city’s target 1.7 million for population protection, have received their first dose, according to QC Task Force Vax to Normal vice chair Joseph Juico.

Another 8.8 percent, or 150,553 individuals, are already fully vaccinated as of June 21, 2021.

To further strengthen its vaccination efforts, the city government partnered with the Diocese of Novaliches, Far Eastern University-Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation (FEU-NRMF), and pharmaceutical company Unilab.

On Monday, Belmonte signed a memorandum of cooperation with Novaliches Bishop Most Rev. Roberto Gaa, FEU-NRMF chief operating officer Juan Enrique Reyes, and Unilab vice president for vaccine initiative Manuel Montinola.

The Diocese of Novaliches will assign parish vaccination sites in Districts 2, 5, 6, and in some parts of District 3.

It currently maintains three jabs sites — Good Shepherd Cathedral in Fairview, San Bartolome Parish in Barangay San Bartolome, and Pagkabuhay Parish in Barangay Bagbag.

The city government will conduct an inspection and assure that there will be enough vaccine supply prior to the opening of new sites,

FEU-NRMF will handle storage facilities and assign doctors and nurses to jabs centers while Unilab will take care of logistical needs and communication support, including link with other healthcare institutions to support the city’s vaccination program. (PNA)
