**MANILA** –  Front-liners who risked their lives and continue doing so against the Covid-19 pandemic were honored Saturday in various Independence Day celebrations.

San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora honored the city's medical and non-medical front-liners who are dedicating their services amid the prevailing public health crisis.

"Pinaglalaban din natin na tuluyan na tayong maging malaya mula sa Covid-19 at iyan naman talaga ang araw-araw nating pinaglalaban (We are fighting to become free from the Covid-19 pandemic)," Zamora said in an interview.

He recognized the efforts, dedication, and sacrifices of the city’s front-liners as their Covid-19 cases are down to 74 as of June 11.

"Bahagi po sila ng ating laban para tuluyang maging malaya ang ating bansa at ang ating lungsod laban sa Covid-19 (They are part of our fight so that our country and our city would free from Covid-19)," Zamora said.

He also reported more than 34,000 residents are already vaccinated, equating to 45 percent of the city's 85,400 target population for inoculation.

"Tayo ay right on track sa ating laban sa Covid-19 at habang bumababa bilang ng mga kaso, tumataas naman po ang bilang ng mga nababakunahan (We are right on track in our fight against Covid-19 and while our number of cases and decreasing, our number of vaccinees are increasing)," he said.

The mayor said the local government targets to be the first to halt the pandemic as it was also the source of the country’s first local transmission.

Zamora said the vaccination program is the last phase of the city government’s fight against Covid-19 and he believes mass population protection will be achieved soon.

"Panawagan sa bawat isa, tayo po ay magpabakuna. Ito po ay makakapagbibigay ng proteksyon at para sa ating pamilya at mahal sa buhay (My call to everyone, let's get vaccinated. This will give us protection, our family and loved ones)," he said.

#### **New heroes**

In Pasig City, Mayor Vico Sotto also lauded medical front-liners who are trying to halt the dreaded virus.

Sotto said the good that came out of the pandemic was uniting Filipinos and the emergence of heroes who stepped up amid the health crisis.

"Sa laban natin ngayon kontra Covid, una nating ipakita na tayo po ay united sa laban natin kontra Covid-19. Tsaka na po muna 'yung mga bagay katulad ng politika. Unahin po muna natin yung mga bagay kung saan iisa lang naman yung kalaban natin (In our fight against Covid-19, let's show that we are united against the pandemic. Let's set aside other things like politics. Let's prioritize dealing with our common enemy)," Sotto said during ceremonies at the Pasig Rizal Park.

Navotas Mayor Toby Tiangco encouraged the public to cooperate in beating the pandemic.

"Gawin sana natin ang ating makakaya para tayo ay makalaya mula sa gapos ng pandemya na mahigit isang taon nang nagpapahirap sa ating lahat (Let's do our best to break free from the shackles of the pandemic that has been hitting us for more than a year now)," Tiangco posted on social media.

"Kung nagawang magka-isa at magtagumpay ng ating mga ninuno para masagip ang Inang Bayan, magagawa rin nating magtulungan para mabigyang proteksyon ang bawat isa laban sa (If our ancestors were able to unite and succeed in saving our Motherland, then, we can also work together to protect each other against) Covid-19," he added.

The Pasay City government joined the celebration by offering flowers in various heroes' monuments around the city.

In Taytay, the local government led by Mayor Joric Gacula held its Independence Day ceremony in a mall.

"May we continue to fight for Philippine sovereignty for the generations after us," the local government said in a social media post.

#### **Blood-letting**

Taytay's Barangay Muzon, meanwhile, conducted a blood donation drive to contribute to the increasing demand for supply among Covid-19 patients.

"Barangay Muzon teamed up with Philippine Red Cross Rizal Chapter for this great cause to save peoples’ lives," a statement read.

Makati Mayor Abby Binay thanked front-liners for serving the city despite the continuing threat of the pandemic.

"Taos pusong pasasalamat mula sa akin at sa puso ng #ProudMakatizens, mga frontliner! Hawak kamay tayo para sa mas ligtas, mas malakas at mas matatag na (Sincere thanks from me and the hearts of #ProudMakatizens, frontliners! Let's hold hands together for a safer, stronger, and more stable) Makati!" Binay said in a social media post.

National Task Force Against Covid-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. commended all pandemic front-line workers in a statement, describing them as "the epitome of courage, determination, and selflessness. The very same qualities of our heroes who, more than a hundred years ago, sacrificed their lives for our nation’s independence." (PNA)
