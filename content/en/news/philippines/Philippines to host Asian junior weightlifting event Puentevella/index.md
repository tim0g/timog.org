**MANILA CITY** â€“ Samahang Weightlifting ng Pilipinas (SWP) president Monico Puentevella on Thursday said the Philippines has been given the hosting chores for the Asian Youth and Junior Weightlifting Championships.

In an interview over the Usapang Sports online forum, the former Negros Occidental congressman said the SWP is now hoping that the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) would allow them to hold the event in the country.

"I'm now announcing [that] the Asian Weightlifting Federation has given me the hosting [rights]," Puentevella said.

He added that the event was initially scheduled to take place in December, but he requested it to be moved to January 2022 instead.

"Puno tayo sa Christmas eh. Gusto ko January, yung focus weightlifting lang (We will be too busy this Christmas. I want that by January, the focus will only be on weightlifting)," Puentevella said.

If given the nod, the event is scheduled to take place at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum in Manila.

Some of the best young weightlifters from Asia are expected to converge together in the said event, including Vanessa Sarno, who lorded over the Asian Weightlifting Championships last April when she won two golds and one silver in the women's 71-kilogram category. (PNA)
