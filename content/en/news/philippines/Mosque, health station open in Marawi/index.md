**CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY** –  The re-opening of a mosque and inauguration of a Barangay Health Station (BHS) were the two recent completion as part of the recovery efforts in Marawi City, the Task Force Bangon Marawi (TFBM) announced on Thursday.

TFBM Chairperson, Secretary Eduardo del Rosario, said the newly restored Masjid Disomangcop mosque is located in Barangay Daguduban, inside Marawi City's most-affected area (MAA).

Its rehabilitation was implemented through the incentivized utilization of housing developers’ escrow funds.

"This is a great milestone for TFBM to be of help and for the first mosque to be inaugurated today," he said.

Del Rosario said the repair of mosques is in compliance with President Rodrigo Duterte’s directive to prioritize the rehabilitation of religious sites.

The refurbishment works for the White Mosque, Masjid Darussalam, Marinaut Masjid, Masjid Macaorao, Grand Mosque, and reconstruction of Dansalan Bato Mosque still continue.

Meanwhile, the TFBM has inaugurated the PHP2.5-million BHS in Rorogagus East, which was constructed under the Marawi Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program with the Bangsamoro government's Ministry of Health (MOH) as the implementing agency.

MOH Minister Bashary Latiph and del Rosario turned over the BHS and medical equipment and supplies to the city government on June 23 to augment its efforts in addressing the health care needs of residents.

Latiph said the inauguration of the Rorogagus BHS is a milestone in the realization of endeavors in attaining optimum health and wellness for the Bangsamoro people.

He said it is one of the 23 BHS projects that would be implemented by the MOH in line with the rehabilitation of Marawi. Two Rural Health Units (RHUs) will also be built.

"Our constituents here in Rorogagus will no longer find it difficult to go to distant RHUs or hospitals as they already have BHS available here to cater to their health care needs. There is someone here who will look after them," he said.

Del Rosario added that about 25 health facilities will be constructed in the less-affected area of Marawi.

Within the MAA, 24 barangay complex structures are now being constructed, with a health center and a madrasah.

Guesting in a radio program at DXMS Radyo Bida on Thursday, Dr. Rolanisah Dipatuan-Dimaporo, MOH chief of staff, said the urgency of the Marawi Compensation Bill that is pending in Congress is a way to give justice and decency to the affected residents, who are still living in temporary shelters.

Saripada Pacasum, resource person for International Alert's Early Response Network, in the same program, said the compensation may not cover entirely the needs of affected residents, but at least it can aid them to start a new life.

"Let the person decide what to do with it (compensation fund)," he said, adding that once residents return to their homes, they need to add resources to purchase additional materials for reconstruction according to their preferences. (PNA)
