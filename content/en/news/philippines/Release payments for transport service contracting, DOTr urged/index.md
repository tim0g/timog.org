**MANILA CITY** –  A lawmaker on Tuesday urged the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Land Transportation, Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to release around PHP4.6 billion worth of payouts for public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers under the transport service contracting program.

In a statement, House Ways and Means Committee chair Joey Salceda cited that only around PHP1 billion of the PHP5.5-billion service contracting budget has been distributed to service contractors such as bus and jeepney operators.

The service contracting program was first launched under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 2) which is set to expire on June 30.

“The service has already been obligated. Filipino workers are clearly in need of more public transport options. The funds are available, although expiring soon. We have to release these funds without delay,” Salceda said.

Salceda stressed that “safe, efficient public transport options” through service contracting will help prevent overcrowding among commuters.

“From the very start of this pandemic, I already asserted that the only way to prevent overcrowding in public transport is through more public transport supply, not bans on public transport routes,” he said.

He argued that it would be difficult to keep the program running if the government is unable to pay contractors for the services they have already rendered.

“May pamilya rin po ang mga nasa transport sector, na pinakanahirapan ngayong pandemic. Paano po sila kakain kung hindi natin binabayaran ang serbisyong ibinigay na nila? (The people in the transport sector have families too, who are severely affected by the pandemic. How could they feed themselves if we are not able to pay for the services that they provide?),” he said.

Salceda also warned of a “looming complication” in paying service contractors due to the expiry of Bayanihan 2, which authorized the program.

“Bayanihan 2 is expiring on June 30. We have to reauthorize the appropriations under the package, or else, we won’t be authorized by any law to pay the service contractors,” he said.

Malacañang on Monday said it will respect the decision of Congress should it extend the validity of Bayanihan 2.

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque made this remark as he confirmed that PHP18.4 billion under the law remain unobligated.

“Well, kinukumpirma ko po ‘no, na sang-ayon po sa datos ng DBM [Department of Budget and Management], ang mga na-obligate po sa Bayanihan 2 ay PHP123.2 billion or 87.01 percent. So may balanse po talaga na PHP18.4 billion or 13 percent (I confirm that according to data from the DBM, the obligated funds of Bayanihan 2 is PHP123.2 billion or 87.01 percent. So, there is still a balance of PHP18.4 billion or 13 percent),” he said in a Palace press briefing.

He, however, said he has yet to find out whether President Rodrigo Duterte would call for a special session to extend the validity of the law.

Last week, Salceda pushed for the holding of a special session while Congress is in recess to discuss a proposal to extend the validity of Bayanihan 2 at least until the end of the year. (PNA)
