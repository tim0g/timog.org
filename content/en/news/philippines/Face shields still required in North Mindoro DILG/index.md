**CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY** – The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) 10 (Northern Mindanao) said Friday the wearing of face shields when in public places is still mandatory in the region.

DILG-10 Assistant Director Yvette Tolentino-Sunga said the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) recommended to President Rodrigo Duterte the mandatory use of face shields.

"While waiting for the President’s decision on the matter, the existing policy on the use of face shields remains to be in effect," she said.

Sunga said the areas specified by the IATF-EID include enclosed or indoor spaces of hospitals, schools, workplaces, and commercial establishments, such as, but not limited to, malls and public markets, public transport and terminals, and places of worship.

She added that public transportation, such as buses and vans, are enclosed settings hence, it is important for people to still use their face shields while on board.

Local Health Support Division Chief, Dr. David Mendoza, who is also the assistant director of the Department of Health 10, said face shields should always be worn inside enclosed settings, such as commercial buildings or malls.

"If you are in the open, you can remove the shield but the mask should always be there," he said.

Mendoza said face shields could add protection from contracting the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) since the face mask could only give 98 percent to 99 percent protection against the virus.

He said putting on the shield would help minimize the transmission of Covid-19 through respiratory droplets. (PNA)
