**CEBU CITY** – The city government here has resumed the inoculation rollout to priority sectors after receiving a fresh supply of vaccines from the Department of Health (DOH), an official said on Thursday.

Dr. Jeffry Ibones, officer in charge of the Cebu City Health Office, said in a radio interview they started inoculating elderlies and persons with comorbidities at the University of Cebu (UC) Alcantara St. Campus, UC Banilad Campus and Robinsons Galleria in North Reclamation Area.

The sites were closed on June 14 after they ran out of vaccines.

“We received the vaccine yesterday (June 16). After we hear the news about the new vaccine supplies, we immediately ordered the resumption of mass immunization to our constituents,” Ibones said in Cebuano.

He said the city received more than 21,000 doses of vaccines but did not mention the brand given to them by the DOH-Central Visayas.

The city aims to accomplish a daily target of 1,170 inoculations, Ibones said.

“A tray carries 1,170 doses. It is necessary that we need to administer that number of doses each day. Otherwise, we’ll have the remaining doses administered the following day,” he said.

Of the seven localities in Metro Cebu, the city was required to open at least four vaccinations sites for residents who are master-listed under the A1 category for medical front-liners, A2 for senior citizens, A3 for persons with comorbidities, and A4 for essential workers.

The city has opened all four sites and also inaugurated on June 12 the New Oasis for Adaptation and a Home Complex at the South Road Properties as the fifth vaccination center. However, it has not begun inoculating individuals, pending approval from the DOH.

Cebu City has registered a total of 645,828 people who are eligible to receive free coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines from the national government.

As of June 10, a total of 28,661 individuals who registered in the city’s online vaccination enlistment portal were given the first dose, and 4,697 of them have also received their second jab. (PNA)
