**CALOOCAN CITY** – Department of the Interior and Local Government Spokesperson and Undersecretary Jonathan E. Malaya has urged local government units (LGUs) to ensure regular updating of their respective COVID-19 data in the Vaccine Monitoring System (VMS) as this will give the true scope of the national COVID-19 vaccination program.
 
Malaya said LGUs should expedite encoding the needed information to the system so that the national government can make informed decisions on where to deploy the next round of vaccines or send additional manpower to help out in the vaccination program.
 
“Napakahalaga na updated ang mga impormasyon sa inyong mga lugar para alam ng national government kung mayroon pa kayong supply ng bakuna, ilang tao na ang nabakunahan at ilang libo ang babakunahan pa, o kaya kailangan ba naming mag-deploy ng karagdagang tauhan para tumulong sa pagbabakuna sa mga lugar ninyo” he stressed.
 
In a report submitted by the DILG Central Emergency Operations Center (EOC), only 444 (27.17 percent) of the total 1,634 cities and municipalities have completed encoding their data to the VMS.

Of this number, however, around 1,190 LGUs have failed to update their data.
 
Malaya said that failing to update information on VMS could lead to low vaccination level, inaccurate deployment of supply, or worse, vaccine irregularities like the alleged slot-for-sale scheme. (PIA NCR)
