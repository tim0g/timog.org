On June 23 to 25, 2021, all resorts and water parks in the province will be closed. In the capital city of Bacolod, similar establishments will also suspend operations on June 24 to prevent huge gatherings usually brought by the feast day of St. John the Baptist celebration.

**BACOLOD CITY** –  All resorts and similar leisure establishments in Negros Occidental and in this capital city will be closed during the feast day of St. John the Baptist on June 24 as part of the stringent measures to curb the continued rise of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases.
 
In Bacolod, Mayor Evelio Leonardia issued Executive Order (EO) 32, series of 2021 on Sunday, suspending public celebrations such as excursions, picnics, revelries, and similar activities this coming Thursday.
 
Leonardia said Bacolod has been experiencing a spike and rebound in infections this June, with the Department of Health-Western Visayas (DOH-6) classifying Bacolod as a “high-risk” area for Covid-19.
 
“Thus, reminding us that even more vigilance and caution must continue to be observed and exercised in matters of public safety and health protocols,” he said.
 
Just like in most places in the country, the feast of San Juan would usually gather big crowds in leisure establishments here and the province such as beach resorts and water parks.
 
In this city, owners of beach resorts, mountain resorts, bars, restaurants, and coffee shops in four villages have agreed to suspend their operations on June 24 after meeting with Leonardia, Vice Mayor El Cid Familiaran, and other officials of the Emergency Operations Center-Task Force (EOC-TF) last week.
 
“This is a big boost to our efforts to contain the spread of the virus because we cannot afford to have the thousands of people who usually flock the beaches of Bacolod during the San Juan fiesta,” Leonardia said.
 
Also under EO 32-2021, the traditional water splashing during the San Juan feast is prohibited.
 
On June 20, Bacolod logged 65 new Covid-19 cases, all local transmission. 
 
It now has a total of 12,065 cases, including 2,270 active cases; 9,502 recoveries; and 293 deaths, data from the DOH-6 showed.
 
Meanwhile, in EO 21-30, Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson also ordered the closure of all beaches, resorts, and waterparks in the province’s 31 cities and municipalities on June 23, 24, and 25 in line with the Feast of San Juan and the rising locally-transmitted Covid-19 cases.
 
“(This), in order to avoid Covid-19 super-spreader activities,” he added.
 
As of June 20, Negros Occidental recorded 17,326 confirmed cases, including 2,633 active cases; 14,385 recoveries; and 308 deaths, according to figures of DOH-6. (PNA)
