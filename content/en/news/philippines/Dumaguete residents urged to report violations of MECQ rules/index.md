**DUMAGUETE CITY** –  To succeed in the fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and slow down the surge in cases, the city government has advised residents to report violations of the health protocols to the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) as it released hotline numbers to the public.

In a media release Monday, the city’s Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) said Covid-19-related reports and queries will be accommodated through the hotlines.

The EOC will address and respond to calls and inquiries on violations of the minimum health standards and protocols by persons or business establishments; travel requirements, follow-up requests for transportation of Covid-19 patients; and other related concerns.

This capital city continues to grapple with a surge in coronavirus cases for several weeks and is now under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ), as is the province of Negros Oriental, from June 16 to 30.

City executive consultant for security concerns retired police general Rey Lyndon Lawas, who is also the EOC manager, in an interview Monday warned against prank calls and false reports to the EOC, saying they can be held criminally liable.

Some people might just take advantage of the situation and make false claims, he said even as he noted that the EOC has a mechanism to verify calls.

Lawas and City Health Officer Dr. Maria Sarah Talla also head the city’s team of health marshals who are primarily tasked to enforce all laws, rules and regulations, and ordinances pertaining to Covid-19 as stipulated by the national and local governments.

The city EOC's hotline numbers are 0945 6611978 (Globe) and 09615246296 (Smart) which can be contacted daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Meanwhile, the Land Transportation Office (LTO)-Dumaguete District Office here is temporarily closed beginning Monday while the province of Negros Oriental is under MECQ.

An announcement was posted on the LTO Region VII’s Facebook page saying that the LTO-Dumaguete will be closed for “disinfection” until further notice.

A source from the LTO-Dumaguete Office who asked not to be named also said the validity of motor vehicle registrations and driver's and conductor's licenses that are set to expire during the MECQ period will be extended.

A copy of an LTO memorandum dated June 15, 2021 and signed by Assistant Secretary Edgar Galvante that was obtained by the Philippine News Agency showed that areas covered by the MECQ including Negros Oriental, as declared by the Palace from June 16-30, will be given certain extensions. (PNA)
