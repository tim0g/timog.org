**MANILA CITY** â€“  The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) reported a magnitude 5 earthquake in Davao Occidental on Tuesday afternoon.

The tectonic quake struck 186 kilometers southeast of Sarangani at 3:35 p.m. It had a depth of 122 km.

Phivolcs' bulletin as of 3:46 p.m. did not mention any reported intensities and instrumental intensities.

Reported intensity is the traditional way of knowing the intensity based on reports by people who felt the earthquake.

On the other hand, instrumental intensity is measured using intensity meter that measures ground acceleration.

Phivolcs, meanwhile, said aftershocks are expected from the magnitude 5 earthquake, while damages are unlikely.

Damage starts at intensity VI based on Phivolcs' scale. (PNA)
