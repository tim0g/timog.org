**MANILA** â€“ The Department of Tourism (DOT) and video making and sharing app Tiktok introduced their newest campaign, #SarapMagingPinoy, to encourage locals to celebrate Filipino pride by sharing treasured dishes from all over the country and promote a renewed interest and love for local cuisines.

The campaign has been received positively by TikTok users, garnering more than 35 million views since it was launched on June 1.

Under the #SarapMagingPinoy campaign, various content creators from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao were tapped to share clips of homemade recipes and dishes on the TikTok platform, with each video showcasing local produce and the diverse cooking styles found in the archipelago.

Some videos even featured home cooks preparing the dishes amid the scenic destinations where these recipes were made popular.

"Food is an integral part of Filipino culture, it reflects our history and our diversity. More importantly, food is what binds us together with our family, friends, and community. Whenever we travel, we travel for food," DOT Secretary Berna Romulo-Puyat said in a news release on Tuesday.

The #SarapMagingPinoy campaign is a form of crowd-sourced community food mapping or associating food with culture and a specific destination, to create compelling stories for travel, with food as an integral part of a traveler's journey.

Users can still take part in the #SarapMagingPinoy campaign until June 15, 2021 by posting recipe videos that feature the best dishes from their cities. Video entries must contain a short introduction that provides viewers with information on the dish and its city of origin.

The video introduction should also include the campaign's thematic messaging of showcasing Filipino pride, and mention the key line, 'Sarap maging Pinoy.'

In the video caption, users must include the hashtag #SarapMagingPinoy, along with a hashtag that indicates your city of origin, using the format #Lutong(city), for example #LutongCebu or #LutongDavao.

"The DOT continuously pushes its food tourism initiatives, and it will always be open to partnering with various innovative and engaging platforms such as TikTok to constantly promote and remind our people about how special our cuisine is to our nation," Puyat said.
