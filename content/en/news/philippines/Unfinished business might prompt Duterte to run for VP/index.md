**MANILA CITY** –  President Rodrigo Duterte’s “unfinished business” during his six-year term as the country’s chief executive might sway him to join the vice presidential race in the 2022 national elections, Malacañang said on Tuesday.

This, after Duterte on Monday expressed openness to the idea of running for vice president next year.

In a virtual press conference, Roque said the unsolved drug problem and corruption in government are among the reasons that might convince Duterte to heed the public’s clamor for him to once again seek a national post after his presidency ends in 2022.

“Meron po siyang unfinished business pagdating po sa droga, pagdating po sa korapsyon (He has unfinished business when it comes to illegal drugs and corruption),” Roque said.

Roque said Duterte believes it is not a “bad idea” to seek the vice presidency.

However, Duterte’s potential vice presidential bid also depends on calls for him to run for vice president, Roque said.

“Ang sinabi naman niya eh kinu-kunsidera niyang tumakbo (He said he’s considering running) only if there is space for him. Kung wala naman po eh okay din naman po (If there is none, that would also be fine),” he said.

Duterte’s decision, Roque said, will also be dependent on the presidential candidate that he will support in next year’s elections.

“Ang isang nakikita niyang problema kung siya ba ay tatakbo ng VP ay baka kontra-partido sila ng Presidente at hindi rin niya magagawa ‘yung unfinished business niya. (One problem that he sees is if he runs for vice president, he might have a strained relationship with the next President, making it hard for him to do his unfinished business),” Roque said.

Duterte’s ruling party, the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan, adopted on May 31 a resolution urging him to join the 2022 vice presidential derby and choose the party’s standard bearer in the 2022 national elections.

Duterte initially said on June 8 he is reluctant to run for vice president, as he is “ready” to retire as the country’s chief executive and return to his home town, Davao City, after his term ends in June next year.

On June 17, Duterte acknowledged that a “lot of people” are urging him to run for vice president, but said his decision will depend on the decision of House Majority Leader and Leyte 1st District Rep. Martin Romualdez who might also seek the second top post in the country. (PNA)
