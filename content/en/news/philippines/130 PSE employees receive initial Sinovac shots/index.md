**MANILA CITY** –  The Taguig local government vaccinated 130 employees of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) through its mobile bus on Friday.

Two vaccination buses were stationed outside the PSE building at the Central Business District in Barangay Fort Bonifacio for the activity.

Mayor Lino Cayetano said the expanded vaccine rollout that now includes economic front-liners is vital in implementing the new normal and gradually reopening the economy.

"Our promise is to make vaccination accessible to all," he said.

One vaccination bus can accommodate at least 500 daily.

Aside from looking forward to a better Christmas this year, Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said the expanded vaccination program will give protection to families, the labor sector, and the economy in general.

PSE president and chief executive officer Ramon Monzon noted that people's confidence is considered one of the stock market drivers, "not only in the Philippines but also worldwide".

"This symbolic vaccination is going to help in restoring the confidence of the investors and hopefully, this will propel our stock market to higher levels," he said.

Monzon said 60 other PSE employees are not yet vaccinated.

"We had a very good turnout. There is no vaccination fear here at the PSE," he said.

Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force Against Covid-19, said the vaccination of economic front-liners symbolizes a whole-of-nation approach against the pandemic.

"Through this, we are only showing that we are helping each other," Galvez said in an interview.

He added the government is more than willing to share its Covid-19 jabs while private sector-procured vaccines have yet to arrive “because we really want to push for the recovery of the economy".

Moreover, Galvez lauded local government units and the private sector for continuously supporting the country's pandemic responses.

Taguig City has already vaccinated 162,146 individuals as of last count, moving its target to inoculate its eligible population from December to early November. (PNA)
