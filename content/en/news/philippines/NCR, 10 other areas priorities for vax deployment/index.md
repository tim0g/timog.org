**MANILA CITY** –  The government's vaccination program continues to prioritize areas experiencing a surge of Covid-19 cases.

National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19 Chief Implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said on Monday the bulk of vaccines are currently deployed to the National Capital Region (NCR) Plus 10, which includes priority areas in Visayas and Mindanao.

“Our deployment is still based on data. We will deploy the vaccines to where it they are much needed which is why the majority of the supplies that we have now are delivered to Visayas and Mindanao areas, and those LGUs (local government units) included in our expanded NCR Plus 10,” Galvez said during the regular briefing with President Rodrigo Duterte.

Bacolod, Iloilo, Cagayan de Oro, Baguio, Zamboanga, Dumaguete, Tuguegarao, General Santos, Naga, and Legazpi are the 10 other areas of concern.

"We are also studying how we can expand the vaccination capacity of some LGUs as we give them additional allocation," Galvez said.

So far, the NCR has received about four million doses, one million doses have been given to Region 4-A (Calabarzon), and Regions 3, 6, 7, and 11 get an average of 400,000 doses each.

The government, Galvez said, will also increase its vaccine allocations to Regions 4-B, 8, 9, and Caraga, amid reports of rising Covid-19 infections. (PNA)
