**MANILA CITY** –  The national government will study the proposal to segregate in workplaces vaccinated and unvaccinated workers, Malacañang said on Monday.

This, after Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion, called on the government and private sector to segregate vaccinated employees from those who refuse to receive the shots.

“Pag-aaralan po natin iyan, dahil all suggestions naman ay dapat pinag-aaralan (We will study that proposal because all suggestions are worthy of review),” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in a Palace press briefing.

Roque welcomed the proposal but noted that there may not be a need for such segregation at the moment.

“Pero sa tingin ko ngayon dahil eight million mahigit-kumulang pa lang ang ating mga nabakunahan ay hindi pa ito iyong panahon na para gawin iyan. Pero pag-aaralan po iyan lalung-lalo na habang dumadami iyong hanay ng mga nabakunahan na (I think, because we’ve only vaccinated around 8 million people, now is not the time to do that. But we will review that proposal especially as more people are getting vaccinated),” he added.

In a television interview, Concepcion raised the possibility of isolating unvaccinated workers to prevent them from infecting those who have been vaccinated.

Among possible areas of separation are elevators, offices, restaurants, cinemas, gyms, and other enclosed places.

As of June 19, the government has administered 8,222,759 doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Of this number, 2,210,134 persons have been fully vaccinated.

Health authorities recorded over 5,000 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, bringing the country’s total to 1,364,239.

Recoveries reached 1,284,643 with 7,053 more patients getting better while 128 more deaths brought the death toll to 23,749. (PNA)
