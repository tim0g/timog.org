**MANILA CITY** –   All overseas Filipinos workers (OFWs) leaving for their posts abroad are welcome to get Covid-19 vaccine shots in Manila even if they are non-residents.

The National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19 said seafarers and other OFWs scheduled to be deployed within the next four months can be accommodated.

During Thursday’s symbolic vaccination for seafarers at the Palacio de Maynila in Malate, Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso thanked the national government for trusting the city with the inoculation.

“Ngayon bibiyahe kayo, nagpapasalamat kami dito sa lungsod ng Maynila na dito kayo babakunahan. Malugod namin kayong tinatanggap at (Now that you are traveling, we thank you that you are receiving your vaccines here in the city. We welcome you and) we are proud of you,” Domagoso told the seafarers in his speech.

Some 1,200 seafarers of the Magsaysay Maritime Corporation were inoculated.

The Association of Marine Officers’ and Seamen’s Union of the Philippines previously said an estimated 30,000 seafarers will be vaccinated within the month.

“They say that Norwegians are good shipbuilders, British are good in navigation, but the best crew in the world is the Filipino crew. We are happy to be of service. Thank you for trusting the city of Manila,” Domagoso said in Filipino.

Trade and Industry Secretary Ramon Lopez, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III, Senator Joel Villanueva, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque Jr., Overseas Workers Welfare Administration chief Hans Cacdac, and NTF deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon attended the event.

Bello said there are about 400,000 documented Filipino seafarers in the global maritime industry. (PNA)
