**MANILA CITY** –  Malacañang has declared June 24, 2021 a special non-working day in the city of Manila to mark its 450th founding anniversary.

Proclamation No. 1167, signed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea on Monday, allows residents to mark the occasion subject to minimum public health standards.

"It is but fitting and proper that the people of the City of Manila be given full opportunity to celebrate and participate in the occasion with appropriate ceremonies, subject to community quarantine, social distancing, and other public health measures," the proclamation read.

Last year, the Manila city government commemorated its 449th founding anniversary with the unveiling of a new 10-story hospital beside the Ospital ng Maynila.

An online tribute to frontline healthcare workers was also one of the highlights of Manila’s 449th founding anniversary.

Several landmarks in the city including Manila City Hall’s clock tower, Jones Bridge, the Post Office Building, and the National Museum were lit up.

Manila City Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso also led wreath-laying activities at Rajah Sulayman along Roxas Boulevard and at San Agustin Church in Intramuros to kick off the celebration.

Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, is the center of the country's economic, political, social, and cultural activity. (PNA)
