**CABARROGUIS, QUIRINO** –  Department of Social Welfare and Development Assistant Secretary Victor Neri  visited this province recently to lead the convergence program which included payout of Livelihood Assistance Grant under the Sustainable Livelihood Program SLP-LAG and Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation (AICS) due to Typhoon Ulysses here recently.

Neri ‘s team  visited four towns here for the distribution of said assistance to some 726 beneficiaries of Nagtipunan (86-LAG; 640-AICS);  323 from Maddela (135-LAG; 188 AICS); 309 from Cabarroguis (122-LAG; 197-AICS) and 273 from Diffun (81-LAG;  192-AICS)

The assistant secretary said they have  been coming back to Cagayan Valley region during the past months to be able to complete the distribution to all  the affected families.

“The cash assistance ranged from P3,000 to P5,000 depending on the assessment for each individual victim of the  typhoon ” Neri said.

He said they had already gone to almost 80 percent of the places affected by  typhoon Ulysses to hand out the assistance adding that they had to postpone their visits to the other places du to the travel restrictions imposed by the IATF.

The assistant secretary has advised the beneficiaries of LAG to consult the different agencies for guidance as to how to invest their livelihood grant.

“Yung mga tatanggap ng Ulysses Assistance Grant, ito lang ang isang laging sinasabi ng ating Presidente,  sa panahon ng kalamidad, huwag po kayong mag-alala, naririnig at nakikita niya po kayo at  marami po siyang reports kung anong pangangailangan ng taong bayan. Kaya  sa panahon ng baha, lindol, sunog, pagputok ng bulkan,  at iba pa, parati kaming pupunta po sa inyo,” Neri assured.

He likewise assured the Quirinians that services like these will continue during President Duterte’s watch as he apologized for the delay of their visit to the typhoon victims.

Neri also lauded the police officers, doctors, nurses and all the  frontliners for their sacrifices in this fight against COVID-19.

“Habang kayo ay ligtas na natutulog sa mga bahay ninyo, lahat po ng mga pulis nasa kalyeng nagbabantay, hiwalay po sa kanilang pamilya. Kaya kung nakita niyo sila at nakitang mayroong rumoronda,  bigyan ninyo ng kape, kamustahin ninyo dahil pagod na pagod na po sila. Kaya po,  facemask, face shield, yun lang po, konting tiis na lang at pag meron na pong bakuna, magpabakuna na po kayo, huwag po kayong matakot sa bakuna, matakot po kayo sa COVID,” Neri told the beneficiaries.

The convergence program also included the distribution of medical assistance by the Office of Senator Bong Go, DA/PLGU assistance to farmers and distribution of cash assistance to those who were tested positive of Covid-19. (MDCT/TCB/PIA 2-Quirino)
