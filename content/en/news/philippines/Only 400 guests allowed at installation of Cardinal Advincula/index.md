**MANILA CITY** –  The Manila Archdiocese is limiting to 400 the number of guests allowed at the installation ceremony of Jose Cardinal Advincula as the 33rd Archbishop of Manila next week in Intramuros, Manila.

Fr. Reginald Malicdem, chancellor of the Manila Archdiocese, said limiting the number of people inside the Manila Cathedral, where the installation rite is set to be held on June 24, is for health and security reasons of those attending the celebration.

He also advised those who will not be able to go inside the cathedral may watch the celebration outside where they will be providing liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors.

“Because of the limited capacity of the Manila Cathedral, it's an event by invitation only. Those who are not part of the invitees could stay outside where there will be LCDs and would be able to witness what is happening inside,” he said in a press briefing Tuesday.

The celebration would be "very simple" with no fanfare, he added.

“We will just be balancing between the celebration and being conscious of the situation because of the pandemic. This is for the logistics and the appeal for everyone to cooperate with protocols in place for the installation of cardinal,” Malicdem said.

Intramuros will be closed in the morning while the ceremony is ongoing. The only entrance and exit will be the gate near the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, he said.

“We beg the understanding of everyone to ensure the safety of all and to follow the health protocols. There will be strict implementation of traffic. Social distancing and use of face mask and face shield inside and outside of the Manila Cathedral. The logistics for traffic and security are in place,” Malicdem said.

The Manila Cathedral, also known as Minor Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, can accommodate a crowd of 2,500.

The last time the archdiocese held such ceremony was on December 12, 2012, when Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle was installed as the new head of the Manila Archdiocese. He was then the bishop of Cavite diocese.

The former Manila archbishop is now the head of the Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of People in Vatican. Pope Francis appointed him to the post in November 2019.

In October 2020, Pope Francis announced the 13 new additions to the College of Cardinals, including Advincula.

After five months, the Capiz archbishop was appointed to head the Manila archdiocese which is home to some 3 million Catholics.

The 69-year-old archbishop is the country’s ninth cardinal, following cardinals Tagle, Orlando Quevedo, Gaudencio Rosales, Jose Sanchez, Ricardo Vidal, Jaime Sin, Julio Rosales and Rufino Santos.

The archdiocese covers the cities of Manila, Makati, Mandaluyong, Pasay and San Juan. (PNA)
