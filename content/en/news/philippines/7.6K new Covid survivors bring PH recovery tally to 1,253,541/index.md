**MANILA CITY** –  The nation’s total number of recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases has climbed to 1,253,541 after 7,637 new recoveries were reported on Wednesday.

In its latest case bulletin, the Department of Health (DOH) noted that recoveries account for 94.1 percent of the total case count which has reached 1,332,832 since the start of the pandemic last year.

The agency also reported 5,414 new cases, bringing the total number of active cases to 56,170.

About 91.4 percent of these active cases are mild, 4.0 percent are asymptomatic, 1.3 percent are critical, 1.9 percent are severe, and 1.36 percent are moderate.

Some 158 new deaths were also reported, pushing the country’s total number of Covid-19 fatalities to 22,963.

According to DOH data on June 14, about 13.7 percent of 36,744 who were tested turned out positive for Covid-19.

"There were 11 duplicates that have been removed from the total case count, and of these, seven were recovered cases. Moreover, 375 cases previously reported to be recoveries have been validated to be active cases, and 117 cases that were previously tagged as recoveries were reclassified as deaths after final validation," the DOH said.

On June 14, six laboratories were not able to submit their data to the Covid-19 Document Repository System (CDRS).

The DOH noted the six non-reporting laboratories contribute, on average, 3.9 percent of samples tested, and 3 percent of positive individuals based on data in the last 14 days.

To date, 58 percent of 3,500 intensive care unit beds, 47 percent of 19,100 isolation beds, 47 percent of 12,500 ward beds, and 37 percent of 2,700 ventilators are utilized by patients with Covid-19 nationwide.
