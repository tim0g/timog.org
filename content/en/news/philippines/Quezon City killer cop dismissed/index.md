**MANILA CITY** –  Master Sgt. Hensie Zinampan, the cop who shot dead a 52-year-old woman in Quezon City, has been dismissed from the service, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Gen. Guillermo Eleazar announced on Thursday.

“Today, I signed the dismissal order of Police Master Sergeant Hensie Zinampan who was found guilty of grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming of a police officer in connection with the killing of 52-year old Lilybeth Valdez on May 31, 2021,” Eleazar said in a statement.

He said the PNP made sure that the entire summary dismissal proceedings followed the existing procedures and policies to prevent technicalities that may only be taken advantage of by Zinampan for him to be reinstated in the police organization.

Zinampan, 42, and assigned to the PNP Police Security and Protection Group, was caught on video fatally shooting his neighbor Valdez in Barangay Greater Fairview.

The suspect is already in police custody and facing murder charges.

“Si Zinampan ay nakakulong ngayon dahil may kinakaharap siyang murder case. Sa panig ng PNP, hindi na siya itinuturing na pulis dahil sa kanyang dismissal order, na ang ibig sabihin din ay tinanggalan na siya ng sweldo at iba pang mga benepisyo (Zinampan is in jail now because he is facing a murder case. On the part of the PNP, he is no longer considered a policeman because of his dismissal order, which also means that he will no longer receive his salary as well as other benefits),” Eleazar said.

He said he hopes that this incident will serve as warning to all PNP personnel that he has zero tolerance for wrongdoings in the organization.

“Ang pagkakatanggal kay PMS Zinampan sa serbisyo ay isa lamang sa mga patunay na hindi namin kinukunsinti ang mga pang-aabuso at mga kamalian sa aming hanay. Ito din ay nagpapatunay na ang disciplinary mechanism sa PNP ay gumagana, matatag at maaasahan (The dismissal of Zinampan from the service is just one of the proofs that we do not tolerate abuses and wrongdoings in our ranks. It also proves that the disciplinary mechanism in the PNP is working, stable and reliable" he added. (PNA)
