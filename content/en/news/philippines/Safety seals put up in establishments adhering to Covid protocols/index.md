**DUMAGUETE CITY** –  The local government unit (LGU) here is granting “safety seals” to business establishments that have complied with the minimum public health standards to curb the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).

Mayor Felipe Antonio Remollo recently created the City Inspection and Certificate Committee, chaired by City Administrator Doram Dumalagan, to inspect private and public establishments, and to issue and/or revoke the safety seal, a media release from the Public Information Office said Wednesday.

“An establishment with the safety seal is proof of its compliance to the minimum public health standards set by the government and uses or integrates its digital contact tracing with StaySafe.ph. application as well as increase consumer confidence to safely reopen the economy,” the statement said.

The committee will inspect the establishments to check whether the required minimum health standards are followed, to include but not limited to the use of thermal scanners, health declaration sheets, Quick Response Codes for StaySafe.ph, and isolation area of identified symptomatic employees.

Other requirements include the display of Barangay Health Emergency Rescue Teams (BHERTs) and other Covid-19 emergency hotlines, handwashing stations, physical barriers, personnel that would ensure physical distancing, proper ventilation, the use of face masks and face shields, a designated safety officer, and a storage facility for infectious wastes, among others.

Meanwhile, the mayor also called on the people to avoid panic buying as stores remain open under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ).

He said the city’s health marshals will strictly enforce the minimum health protocols of wearing face masks and face shields and observing physical distancing, as he also outlined guidelines for Dumaguete under the MECQ from June 16-30.

Majority of the guidelines are adopted from the National Inter-Agency Task Force (NIATF) although some have been “tweaked” according to the needs of the city.

Persons 17 years old and below and 66 years old and above are to strictly stay at home, as well as those with immuno-deficiencies and comorbidities, and pregnant women.

Establishments, public and private offices, and other institutions are also allowed to operate, and depending on their nature, either on 100 percent full capacity or only up to 50 percent.

Among those not allowed to operate are entertainment venues with live performers such as karaoke bars, bars, clubs, concert halls, theaters, and cinemas; recreational venues such as internet cafes, billiard halls, amusement arcades, and the like; amusement and theme parks; outdoor sports courts for contact sports, games, and other activities; indoor sports courts or venues, fitness studios, gyms, spas or other indoor leisure centers or facilities, and swimming pools, and others as stipulated in the NIATF guidelines.

Indoor dine-in services of food establishments are also not allowed, but only take-out and/or delivery, while only hotels that are accredited with the Department of Tourism are allowed to operate.

People are advised to carry with them valid identification cards to be presented at checkpoints.

Curfew hours are from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. the following day, while a liquor ban is imposed. (PNA)
