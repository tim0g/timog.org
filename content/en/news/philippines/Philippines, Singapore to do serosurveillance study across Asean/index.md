**MANILA CITY** –  The Philippines and Singapore will do a serosurveillance study to test the efficacy of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) across Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).

Seroconversion is the process of developing specific antibodies in human blood as a result of immunization or infection.

"Kapag tayo ay nabakunahan o nainfect ng bacteria or virus, ang katawan ay gumagawa ng antibodies para sa susunod na ang mga ito ay makapasok sa ating katawan, mas mabilis na nya itong malabanan (When someone was inoculated or was infected by bacteria or virus, the body produces antibodies to better fight this bacteria or virus once it enters the body again)," Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency Wednesday night.

Serosurveillance, she said, is an effective method to monitor the diseases that can be prevented by the vaccine.

This is also used to determine which groups are at risk, and to give proper information on the estimated percentage of people who were inoculated, Guevara added.

The DOST will provide funding support for the project.

"The final amount is still being discussed, but it is approximately USD600,000. This will be divided among participating Asean member states," the official said.

Guevara said they target to start the study by September, with 200 participants from each Asean member state.

Meanwhile, according to the DOST, the study will look at different stages of vaccination, as well as the longevity of immunity from getting inoculated.

This will be jointly led by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, Singapore’s Duke-NUS Medical School, and the Diagnostics Development Hub, the DOST said. (PNA)
