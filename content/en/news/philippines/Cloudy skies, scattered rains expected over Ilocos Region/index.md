**MANILA CITY** –  The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) on Sunday said cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms will prevail over Ilocos Region and the provinces of Zambales, Bataan, Occidental Mindoro, and Palawan due to southwest monsoon.

In its 5 a.m. weather bulletin, the weather bureau said partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers are also expected in Metro Manila and the rest of the country due to southwest monsoon or localized thunderstorms.

It warned affected residents against possible flash floods or landslides due to scattered moderate to at times heavy rains.

Moderate to strong winds and moderate to rough coastal waters will prevail over Northern and Central Luzon, PAGASA said.

The rest of the country will experience light to moderate winds and slight to moderate seas, it added.

The minimum temperature will be 26.5°C and the maximum temperature will be 33 °C. (PNA)
