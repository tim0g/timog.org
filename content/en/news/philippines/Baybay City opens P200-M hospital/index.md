**BAYBAY CITY, Leyte** – The city government here opened its PHP200-million Western Leyte Provincial Hospital, raising its capability to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients.
 
Chief of hospital Christine Baldevia said the opening of the hospital is “very timely” due to the spike of Covid-19 cases. 
 
Baldevia said the hospital has allocated 15 beds for Covid-19 patients and a birthing clinic for Covid-19 positive pregnant women.
 
“We can cater moderate to severe Covid-19 patients or those who do not need mechanical ventilators,” she said in an interview on Monday.
 
As of June 20, Baybay City recorded 326 confirmed Covid-19 cases, including 308 recoveries and four deaths. The city has 13 active cases.
 
With a new hospital facility in the city, Mayor Jose Carlos Cari said they expect to improve the quality of hospital care especially during this time of the pandemic.
 
“The hospital is a facility tasked to respond in times of pandemic. They are expected to respond and in fact we already constructed a Covid-19 ward in this hospital and it is ready for use,” Cari said.
 
The 50-bed capacity hospital offers medical and health services, such as obstetrician-gynecology, ophthalmology, orthopedic, birthing clinic, medical and surgical wards, emergency, and out-patient.
 
The Office of Civil Defense also turned over the new hospital mobile X-rays and 25 mechanical beds.
 
Western Leyte Provincial Hospital was one of the hospitals managed by the provincial government of Leyte. 
 
Its management was transferred to the city government in 2020 after Baybay City expressed its intention to build its own hospital.
 
The city transferred the facility’s location to the diversion road through funding from the Department of Public Works and Highways. 
 
The hospital was designed to provide for the healthcare needs of Baybay City and neighboring Mahaplag, and Inopacan towns. (PNA)
