**CEBU CITY ** – Tour guides and tricycle drivers in the tourism towns of Moalboal and Badian in southern Cebu province have expressed their thanks to Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go for sending them assistance in coping with the effect of the pandemic on their livelihood.

Gerardo Gocotano, one of the beneficiaries in Moalboal who received a bicycle, shared his gratitude towards Go and his team.

Gocotano said the assistance is a big help to their community during this time of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) crisis.

“Mr. Christopher Bong Go, you are also a Visayan, I am also a Visayan. Thank you so much, Senator, for the help you gave, the bicycle that I receive. Our family has always loved you because during the first election ­­– Mr. Bong Go, we love you because you really help,” Gocotano said in Filipino.

Pelario Cataytay Jr., a 39-year-old beneficiary, expressed his appreciation towards the assistance the senator provided, saying “Salamat sa ibinigay niya ngayong tulong sa katulad kong drayber, habal-habal driver, malaking tulong na po ito pambili ng bigas at ulam para sa pamilya ko (Thanks to the help he gave today to a driver like me, habal-habal driver, this is a big help to buy rice and a dish for my family).”

In a statement on Friday, Go said his team delivered on two different occasions (June 15 in Moalboal and June 16 in Badian) the assistance for the tourist guides and tricycle drivers in these adjacent municipalities whose jobs and livelihood are dependent on tourism.

The tourism industry is one of the sectors affected due to strict community quarantine amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Go said distributing the aid to the affected individuals has been part of his commitment to helping the various sectors recover from the pandemic.

The tricycle drivers who received assistance were members of the Tricycle Operators and Drivers Association.

The relief operation in Moalboal was conducted at the Barangay Tunga Covered Court where 291 beneficiaries received grocery packs, meals, masks, face shields, and vitamins. The beneficiaries were grouped into small batches to ensure a well-coordinated distribution as they strictly followed the safety and health protocols.

In Badian, Go's staff organized the distribution activity at the Badian Training Center and Malhiao Covered Court where the 689 beneficiaries were likewise grouped into small batches and strictly followed the safety and health protocol to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus.

The beneficiaries received grocery packs, meals, masks, face shields, and vitamins. 

Considering that the access to public transportation is limited, Go gave new pairs of shoes and bicycles to selected recipients which they can use for a more convenient commute.

Some beneficiaries also received computer tablets that would be of great benefit to their children who are pursuing education under the blended learning setup.

Go, in a video message, acknowledged that the tourism industry continues to be one of the sectors immensely hit by the coronavirus pandemic but reassured the beneficiaries that the government is developing measures to slowly help build back a more resilient tourism economy.

The Department of Social Welfare and Development granted each recipient with financial assistance through their program to help those in crisis situations while the Department of Trade and Industry and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority committed to evaluate qualified individuals who can be part of their respective livelihood and scholarship programs.
