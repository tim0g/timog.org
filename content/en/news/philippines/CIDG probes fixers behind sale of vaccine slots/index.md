**MANILA CITY** –  Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Gen. Guillermo Eleazar ordered on Tuesday the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) to look into the illegal operations of “fixers” who seek payment from people who want to get vaccinated right away by having their schedules moved up.

Eleazar issued the directive after Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto disclosed that two fixers were caught asking fees in exchange for allowing persons to get Covid-19 shots ahead of their schedules in the vaccination program.

“Maaaring hindi lang sa Pasig nangyayari ang ganitong modus at dapat ay matuldukan agad ito (Maybe this modus operandi is not only in Pasig. This should be stopped immediately). We will closely coordinate with our LGUs to prevent the proliferation of this modus,” Eleazar said in a statement sent to reporters on Tuesday.

Eleazar appealed to the public to avoid falling prey to the scheme and urged them to patiently wait for their scheduled vaccination.

Vaccination is offered free and the public only has to register and wait for their schedule.

“Tubuan naman sana ng kunsiyensiya ang mga fixers na ito at maawa sa ating mga kababayan. Marami ang nagnanais magpabakuna pero nararapat pa din sundin natin ang priority list sa pagpapabakuna. May dahilan po kung bakit sila priority sa listahan (These fixers have no conscience, no mercy on our countrymen. Many people want to get vaccinated but we should still follow the priority list for vaccination. There is a reason why there is a priority list),” he added.

The public is urged to report to authorities any information about vaccination fixers through the PNP's different e-Sumbong platforms. (PNA)
