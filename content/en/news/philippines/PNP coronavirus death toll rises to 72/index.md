**MANILA CITY** â€“  The number of police officers who have died from the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has climbed to 72.

In an update Tuesday, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief, Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said the latest fatality is a 42-year-old policeman from Agusan del Norte.

Citing reports from the PNP Health Service, the police officer experienced fatigue and shortness of breath on June 14.

On June 15, the victim went to a nearby municipal health center for a check-up but the attending physician said he should undergo a swab test.

Instead of heeding the doctor's advice, the patient returned to his quarters, tried "tuob" (steam inhalation), and hired a massage therapist. On June 17, he was admitted to the hospital and underwent laboratory tests.

On June 18, the patient underwent a swab test which yielded positive results a day later. At around 2 a.m. on June 20, he passed away while undergoing endotracheal intubation.

Meanwhile, the PNP also recorded 97 new Covid-19 cases, bringing the total number of active cases to 1,840.

Another 123 recoveries raised the total count to 25,011, out of a total of 26,923 infections since the pandemic started last year.

So far, a total of 26,144 police officers were vaccinated against Covid-19.

Out of this number, 12,232 are already fully vaccinated. (PNA)
