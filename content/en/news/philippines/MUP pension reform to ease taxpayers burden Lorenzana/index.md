**MANILA CITY** â€“ The current pension system for military and uniformed personnel (MUP) has to undergo reforms as allowing it to continue will become burdensome for taxpayers, Department of National Defense (DND) Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said Monday.

"The current MUP pension system that is being subsidized by the government will become unsustainable in the near future as it will become a huge burden to our taxpayers," Lorenzana said in a statement.

He added that revisiting the pension system should have the objective of generating and maintaining a self-sustaining fund that would totally or partially unburden the government financially.

"As of today, the proposed MUP pension reform is still being discussed in Congress. A careful study of our fiscal situation, gathering of suggestions from concerned stakeholders especially in our Armed Forces, and further deliberations will be undertaken and considered to fine-tune the proposed bill," he added.

Lorenzana added that the welfare of MUP retirees is their utmost priority in talking with lawmakers regarding the matter.

"Looking after the welfare of our soldiers is one of the key mandates of the DND, and this includes ensuring that they receive the appropriate retirement benefits that are due them for their years of honorable and dedicated service," he added.

Last week, the House Ad hoc Committee on the MUP Pension System approved the unnumbered substitute bill after significant issues were resolved among the committee members and with the military and uniformed services branches.

Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, committee chair, said among the key revisions in the bill include the addition of disability benefits in the authorized insurance system and the creation of a provident fund to be infused with voluntary contributions from MUPs.

The disability benefits shall be created under the risk insurance system to enhance the benefits package for MUPs who incur disabilities in the line of duty.

The bill also provides a harmonized definition for what constitutes an MUP member.

Salceda also said law enforcement agencies such as the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency should be included in the definition of uniformed services.

Other features of the bill include the removal of automatic indexation but retention of the no-contribution scheme, pension increases based on a cost-of-living adjustment, rationalizing pensionable age at 56 years old, and allowing optional retirement at 20 years.

Also proposed are higher risk insurance coverage for those wounded or killed in action, and the creation of a military and uniformed services trust fund, with leeway to initiate a credible defense posture. (PNA)
