**MANILA CITY** –  The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) remembered the late former president Benigno Aquino III for his "remarkable legacy" on Philippine foreign policy and national history.

The DFA said Aquino "elevated the country’s conduct of foreign relations, steered foreign policy towards a principled direction that earned international respect and esteem, and invigorated the foreign service with a collective sense of patriotism, commitment to service, and professionalism."

"The Department offers its condolences to the former president’s family and friends, and joins the Filipino people in grieving the loss of a great man, leader and nationalist," it said in a statement.

Sharing his grief over social media, DFA Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. described Aquino as incorruptible and indifferent to power.

"I’m out of Twitter from grief over the death of a sea-green incorruptible, brave under armed attack, wounded in crossfire, indifferent to power and its trappings, and ruled our country with a puzzling coldness but only because he hid his feelings so well it was thought he had none; it was the way he and his siblings were raised by a great woman — their mother and of our restored democracy (without her none in power yesterday and today would be)," he said.

"I beg his sisters to allow me the honor to share their grief. He wasn’t fond of me but I could not bring myself not to admire him," he added.

It was under Aquino's presidency that the Philippines initiated a case against China over its expansive claims in the South China Sea.

In 2016, the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that Beijing's nine-dash line had no basis in law.

Aquino, also known as Noynoy and PNoy (President Noynoy) as the 15th president of the Philippines from 2010 to 2016, succumbed to renal failure secondary to diabetes at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at the Capitol Medical Center in Quezon City.

He turned 61 on February 8.

He was the only son of former senator Benigno Aquino Jr. and former President Corazon Aquino.

His elder sister, Pinky Abellada, confirmed his passing when she faced the media along with sisters Ballsy Cruz, Viel Dee, and Kris Aquino.

Heartfelt condolences

The diplomatic community also joined Filipinos in mourning Aquino's death.

The European Union (EU) Delegation in Manila said Aquino was a "friend who pushed for deepening of our relations" and that it was under his administration that the EU-Philippines Partnership and Cooperation was signed.

"The EU Delegation and the EU family in Manila express their condolences to the Aquino family and the whole nation on the passing of former President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III. Fond memories of his visit to Brussels in 2014. We mourn a friend who pushed for deepening of our relations," it said.

United States Embassy Chargé d'Affaires John Law also shared his sympathies with the Aquino family.

"On behalf of the US Embassy, I offer our deepest condolences to former President Benigno Aquino III’s family and loved ones at this heartbreaking time. We are saddened by President Aquino’s passing and will always be thankful for our partnership," he said.

The French Embassy extolled Aquino for his "legacy of leadership and reform founded on democratic values, economic prosperity, and honesty".

The embassy said bilateral ties between Paris and Manila reached "new heights" during his leadership when he welcomed former president François Hollande to Manila in 2015.

"It was during this historic first visit of a French Head of State to the Philippines that our two presidents jointly launched the Manila Call to Action on Climate Change – a mark of our two countries’ shared commitment to the fight against climate change and a symbol of the growing partnership and friendship between France and the Philippines," it said.

Legacy of partnership

Also extending their condolences were the Spanish Embassy, United Kingdom Ambassador to Manila Daniel Pruce, and Australian Ambassador Steven Robinson.

"We offer our condolences to the family of former President Benigno Aquino III and the Filipino people. While the Philippines mourns his loss, we remember fondly his State Visit to Australia in 2012 and the legacy of partnership and bayanihan we shared," Robinson said over Twitter.

The Swiss Embassy said the Switzerland-Philippine relations were likewise strengthened during Aquino's term.

"The Embassy of Switzerland in the Philippines wishes to express its sincere condolences to the Filipino people and the family of former President of the Republic of the Philippines, Benigno ‘Noynoy’ Aquino III," it said.

"President Aquino had the opportunity to visit Switzerland in 2013 for the World Economic Forum held in Davos, the annual gathering of government and private sector leaders who come together to discuss global issues. CH-PH relations were also strengthened during his administration," it added.

The German Embassy, on the other hand, recalled Aquino's state visit to Germany in 2014 when he met former German Federal President Joachim Gauck and Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.

"The Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany to the Philippines, with great sadness and sorrow, expresses its heartfelt condolences to the Filipino people and the family of the late former President of the Philippines Benigno ‘Noynoy’ Aquino III," it said.

"As a great friend of Germany, his official state visit in the Federal Republic of Germany in September 2014 marked an important milestone in intensifying German-Philippine relations," it added.

The Netherlands Ambassador to Manila, Saskia de Lang, said Aquino's administration "exemplified how decisive reforms and good governance can spur economic growth and sustainable progress."

"The Philippines and the Netherlands enjoyed strong economic and political bilateral ties under his leadership, and we continue to build on that until this day. On behalf of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, I extend my deepest sympathies to his family and loved ones left behind during this difficult time," she said.

The DFA said Philippine flags in embassies and consulates across the world will be flown at half-mast in honor of the former president. (PNA)
