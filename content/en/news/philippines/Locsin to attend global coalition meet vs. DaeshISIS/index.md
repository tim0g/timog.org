**MANILA CITY** â€“  Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. will participate in the ministerial meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh/ISIS in Rome, Italy on June 28, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) announced Thursday.

The 83-member Global Coalition will gather ministers to discuss ways to sustain efforts to complete the defeat of Daesh/ISIS and of terrorism worldwide.

The Philippines became the 75th member of the Coalition in 2018, signifying its commitment to reinforcing its counter-terrorism programs, including addressing the socioeconomic concerns of vulnerable communities.

As part of the visit, Locsin will grace the opening of the new chancery of the Philippine Embassy in Rome. At present, Italy is home to around 165,000 Filipinos.

The DFA said Locsin will be joined by Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Civilian Security and Consular Affairs Brigido Dulay and National Security Council Deputy Director-General Damian L. Carlos. (PNA)
