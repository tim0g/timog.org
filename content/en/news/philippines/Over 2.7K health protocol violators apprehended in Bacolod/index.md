**BACOLOD CITY** –  The Bacolod City Police Office (BCPO) on Wednesday urged residents here to abide by the minimum health protocols against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) to avoid getting fined or being made to do community service.

Lt. Col. Lester Leada, head of the BCPO Operations Management Unit, issued the reminder in a statement after 2,761 persons here have been apprehended for violating health protocols from June 1 to 13.

“Violators were not taken into custody, but were instead given citation tickets and warned not to commit any more violations,” he said.

Records showed that of the number, 1,044 were caught not wearing face masks, and 737 not wearing face shields.

A total of 427 individuals were apprehended for violating the curfew ordinance, and 340 for violating the liquor ban while 213 were called out for failing to comply with the one-meter requirement for physical distancing.

Since January 1 this year, 22,169 protocol violators have already been booked by the BCPO as a result of the operations conducted by personnel of Police Stations 1 to 10, along with operatives of Mobile Patrol Unit, Bacolod City Mobile Force Company, and Traffic Enforcement Unit.

Violators are fined PHP200 each if they are from Bacolod, and PHP300, if they are from out-of-town as provided in a city ordinance.

Leada said the BCPO continues to conduct information and education campaign through “recorida (tour and record)” to raise awareness on the risk of getting infected with Covid-19.

As of June 16, Bacolod has a total of 11,534  Covid-19 cases, including 1,918 active cases; 9,324 recoveries; and 292 deaths, records of the Department of Health-Western Visayas showed. (PNA)
