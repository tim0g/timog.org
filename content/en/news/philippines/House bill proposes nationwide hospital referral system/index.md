**MANILA CITY** –  A national patient navigation and referral system that will strengthen the provision of health care delivery system is contained in House Bill 9633, which seeks to institutionalize and broaden the scope of the One Hospital Command System.

Through the establishment of the National Patient Navigation and Referral System (NPNRS), patients can navigate through different levels of the health system, stated the bill that was sent to the media on Tuesday.

Quezon 4th District Rep. Angelina Tan, who filed the bill on Monday, said the measure would link with Malasakit Centers nationwide to ensure financial risk protection, particularly for the indigent and financially incapacitated patients.

The NPNRS is designed to support, strengthen, and facilitate the provision of health services of primary care providers acting as the navigator, coordinator, and initial and continuing point of contact in the health care delivery system pursuant to Republic Act No. 11223, otherwise known as the Universal Health Care Act.

"With its institutionalization, the NPNRS is geared to redefine and reform the nature of the health delivery system of the Philippines to become more responsive and towards greater equity, accessibility, and quality," Tan said.

Health Undersecretary and Covid-19 treatment czar Leopoldo Vega earlier said the One Hospital Command Center (OHCC) should serve as a “coordinated referral for all” nationwide as the country continue to grapple with the pandemic.

OHCC currently facilitates a comprehensive and coordinated response to the Covid-19 pandemic by ensuring effective and efficient health facility referral in Metro Manila to reduce the waiting time of patients by referring them to the appropriate health facility.

Under the bill, the NPNRS will support and strengthen the province-wide and city-wide health care provider networks throughout the country.

It will facilitate coordination among local government units, hospitals, infirmaries, other health facilities, telehealth service providers, local, and national government agencies to maximize the use of limited health resources, and improve access to quality health services for patients.

It will likewise serve as a guide in directing patients as well as a gatekeeper in ensuring rational and efficient use of existing health resources; and interconnect and facilitate communication among hospitals, infirmaries, other health facilities, telehealth service providers, local, and national government agencies to improve access to quality health services for patients.

Tan said the bill will bolster OHCC’s ongoing efforts to facilitate medical transport and patient pick-up arrangements, provide health system capacity data analytics and risk communications, and optimize the use of critical care services of every hospital not only in Metro Manila but in the entire country.

It will be made possible through the establishment of the Regional Patient Navigation and Referral Units, which will serve as the implementing arm of the NPNRS in all regions. (PNA)
