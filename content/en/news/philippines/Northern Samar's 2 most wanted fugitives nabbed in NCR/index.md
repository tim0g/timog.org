**MANILA CITY** â€“  Two most wanted persons (MWP) in Northern Samar were arrested in separate operations in Valenzuela City and Manila over the weekend, the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) said on Monday.

Maj. Gen. Vicente Danao Jr., NCRPO director, identified the suspects as Rommel Cerbito, 23, and Beltran Cerbito, 55, who were listed as the province's Top 2 and 3 MWP, respectively.

Beltran was arrested by local police and personnel of the Regional Special Operations Group Provincial Intelligence Unit, Northern Samar at around 1:45 p.m. Sunday at St. Joseph Compound in Barangay Bagbaguin, Valenzuela City.

Meanwhile, Rommel was arrested in Zaragoza St., Tondo, Manila at around 2:45 p.m.

The two suspects have a standing warrant of arrest for rape issued by the Laoang, Northern Samar Regional Trial Court (RTC).

"Hindi natin hahayaan na magtago sa ating rehiyon ang mga wanted sa ating bansa. Sa tulong at koordinasyon ng bawat unit ng pulisya sa bansa mahahanap at mahahanap natin ang mga nagkasala sa batas (We will not allow these wanted criminals hide in our region. With the help and coordination of every police unit in the country we will find and locate those who break the law)," said Danao.

The two suspects were brought to Valenzuela Medical Center for medical examination and were subsequently turned over to the custodial facility unit of the Valenzuela City police. (PNA)
