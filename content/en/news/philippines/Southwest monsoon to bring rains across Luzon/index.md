**MANILA CITY** â€“  Rains are expected over most parts of Luzon due to the southwest monsoon affecting the island Thursday.

Cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms will prevail over Ilocos Region, Apayao, Abra, Benguet, Cagayan, Bataan, Zambales, Occidental Mindoro, and northern Palawan, including the Kalayaan Islands.

"Flooding is possible during heavy rains," Benison Estareja of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said.

Most areas in the Visayas, on the other hand, will have partly cloudy to cloudy skies, and isolated rain showers that may last for a short period.

There are chances of rains over Mindanao, and thunderstorms are likely in the afternoon, Estareja said.

No gale warning is currently in effect, according to Estareja. Light to moderate winds and slight to moderate seas will prevail over the entire archipelago.

Meanwhile, PAGASA is monitoring a tropical storm with the international name "Champi". It was last tracked 1,970 kilometers east of extreme northern Luzon.

"It is far from the (Philippine) landmass and is at the northeastern boundary of PAR (Philippine Area of Responsibility). We don't expect it to have a direct effect on the country," he said.

Estareja, however, said that if the tropical storm continues to move upward, it may enhance the southwest monsoon. (PNA)
