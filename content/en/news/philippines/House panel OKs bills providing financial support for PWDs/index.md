**MANILA CITY** â€“  A House of Representatives panel on Wednesday approved a measure which provides for an annual PHP750 emergency grant to persons with disabilities (PWDs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) crisis.
 
During its virtual hearing, the House Special Committee on Persons with Disabilities, chaired by Negros Occidental Rep. Ma. Lourdes Arroyo, approved House Bill 7180, otherwise known as the Covid-19 Emergency Health Grant for Persons with Disabilities Act.
 
Arroyo, who was also author of the bill, said disability is not accounted for in existing anti-poverty measures of the government, which is reflected in the lack of targeted programs for the sector even with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).
 
She particularly noted that members of the PWD community who are undisputedly identified as a vulnerable sector and eligible beneficiaries of the Social Amelioration Program have "essentially been excluded" from being able to obtain the much-needed support and assistance from their fair share of the SAP.
 
The bill seeks to provide targeted financial assistance called "emergency disability health grants" to PWDs to help cover disability-related costs acquired from the Covid-19 pandemic and under the new normal.
 
The PHP750 grant shall be given as an annual lump sum. The grant will follow the cash transfer mechanism.
 
The DSWD shall be the lead agency in the implementation of the proposed law as it ensures the PWDs will get immediate, secure, and direct access to the cash grant.
 
The committee likewise approved House Bill 9243, which would grant additional benefits to PWDs.
 
It would amend for the purpose Republic Act 7277, or the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons.
 
When enacted into law, PWDs would be entitled to a monthly stipend amounting to PHP500 to augment the daily subsistence and other medical needs of the beneficiaries.
 
Meanwhile, National Council on Disability Affairs (NCDA) Executive Director Engr. Emerito Rojas raised that Congress must consider the fund availability, fund source, identification of qualified recipients, as well as cost-benefit analyses in finalizing the bills. (PNA)
