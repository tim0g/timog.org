**MANILA CITY** –  The Quezon City government has issued an ultimatum to Zuellig Pharma Corp., the firm behind eZConsult, to improve its system following difficulties in the registration and booking for Covid-19 vaccination.

Mayor Joy Belmonte said Wednesday Zuellig has committed to providing seamless service but has repeatedly failed to deliver.

“We have issued an ultimatum to Zuellig so they can improve their system quickly and provide all the deliverables. If not, we have no other choice but to find another company that can do the job quickly and efficiently,” Belmonte said.

Residents have been complaining about the inaccessibility of the eZConsult website, preventing them from getting registered or booking an appointment for the vaccination, she said.

“Kaya natin kinuha ang serbisyo ng eZConsult ay para mapadali ang proseso ng pagpapatala, ngunit ano ang gagawin natin kung ang sistema nila mismo ang ugat ng problema (We got the services of eZConsult to make the registration process easier, but what should we do if the root of the problem is the system itself),” Belmonte said.

The city government is also considering filing damages against the company by Friday for failing to meet its contractual obligation to the local government.

“If there would be no significant improvement, we would initiate contract termination proceedings and file appropriate charges against them as deemed appropriate by our city legal counsel to enforce and protect our rights and the interest of QCitizens,” Belmonte said.

The city government, she said, has improved the system for the actual vaccination at the different sites to make the process more efficient and avoid long queues.

She added that they try to vaccinate people within a maximum of 45 minutes so long as the vaccine supply is stable.

“Yet, eZconsult is putting all our efforts down the drain," Belmonte said.

As early as March 27, various technical difficulties have been experienced while accessing the eZConsult system, causing the slowdown of the vaccination process.

Lawyer Orlando Casimiro of the City Legal Department already wrote Zuellig Pharma, demanding liquidated damages.

Casimiro cited that under the terms of reference of their agreement, Zuellig has the obligation to make available Information Technology services, such as registration, pre-assessment, booking, and scheduling of vaccination at the patient level through its digital platform.

“Failure to strictly comply with the terms of the contract shall constrain us to take all necessary legal action as may be appropriate, including both civil and criminal cases against Zuellig and its officers, for the full protection and enforcement of the Quezon City government’s rights and interests,” he said.
