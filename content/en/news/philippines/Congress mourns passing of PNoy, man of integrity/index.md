**MANILA CITY** –  Members of the House of Representatives mourned the passing of former president Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III on Thursday with glowing tributes, describing him as a "man of integrity" who "dedicated his service" to the country.

"We are saddened to learn of the passing of former president Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III. The entire House of Representatives would like to extend its heartfelt sympathies and condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues at this difficult time," Speaker Lord Allan Velasco said in a statement.

Velasco said Aquino dedicated his service to the country as a three-term representative of the second district of Tarlac, senator (2007 to 2010), and President.

House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez of Leyte’s First District said Aquino made it his "primary mission" to institutionalize good governance reforms.

"The news of his death was a shock to all of us. We all grieve for losing him so early — a man of integrity," Romualdez said. "We extend our condolences to his family and loved ones. May you find peace in knowing that he is now back to the loving embrace of our Father."

Davao del Norte First District Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez said while he did not agree with many of Aquino's decisions when he was in office, he never doubted his sincerity in wanting what is best for the country.

“President Aquino III, as with the other presidents who came before him, did his best to make this country better. The results have been mixed, as history and experience would show. But this should not discourage us,” he said.

Alvarez also noted that Aquino did not aspire for the presidency, but still answered the country's call for him to serve, which he described as a "selfless and courageous" decision.

"Five years ago, he stepped down as the most powerful man in the country. Five years later, he’s gone, just like that; a strong reminder to us all that we’re merely transient. When God makes a roll call and our name is called, finished or not finished, we have to pass our paper. And what we do during our impermanent visit to this world, is what we leave behind," Alvarez said.

ACT-CIS Party-list Rep. Rowena Niña Taduran said Aquino had hits and misses but showed dedication for the country with his courageous stand against a "world superpower" and corrupt local officials.

“President Aquino was the leader who brought China to court. His unrelenting drive to defend the country’s rights over certain areas in the West Philippine Sea shook the feathers of those who are trying to encroach on our territory," Taduran said in another statement.

She also recognized Aquino’s role in putting a dent on the pork barrel scam.

“The exposure of the pork barrel scam, wherein government funds have been siphoned for bogus projects, was significant in putting a cork on corruption. It was a game changer in Philippine politics,” she said.

The former president, Taduran said, also saved an overseas Filipino worker (OFW) from being executed in Indonesia.

“The former President fought strongly for Mary Jane Veloso’s life. He did not stop pleading to the Indonesian government until the last minute. Speaking as an advocate for the welfare of the OFWs, what Aquino did was highly admirable and should be emulated by other leaders of our country,” she said.

Former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, also a former House Speaker and Aquino’s professor at Ateneo de Manila, acknowledged his family's contribution to the country.

"My family and I join the Filipino people in prayers and sympathy on the passing of former president Benigno Aquino III. Aside from his own achievements, he will be remembered as part of the Aquino family who has contributed three important people to the history of our nation, Senator Ninoy Aquino and our 11th and 15th presidents, Cory and Noynoy Aquino," Arroyo said.
