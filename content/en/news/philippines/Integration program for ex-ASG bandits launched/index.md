**ZAMBOANGA CITY** –  The Marine Battalion Landing Team-7 (MBLT-7) together with the Municipal Task Force to End Local Armed Conflict (MTF-ELAC) of Kalingalan Caluang, Sulu launched a Local Social Integration Program (LSIP) to encourage former Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) bandits to embrace a new and productive life.

Col. Hernani Songano, 4th Marine Brigade commander, said Wednesday the LSIP recipients are 15 former ASG members from Barangay Kambing, Kalingalan Caluang, who surrendered to the MBLT-17.

Julkiram Arastam, provincial tourism officer and focal person of Sulu Task Force-ELAC, and Kalingalan Caluang Mayor Nurshamier Halun, joined Songano during the launch of the program Monday in Barangay Kambing.

Songano said they have tapped the different government agencies civic groups and religious leaders to help them address the livelihood, beliefs, education issues, and concerns of the 15 ASG surrenderers.

He said on the same day, a community livelihood program, dubbed Habi para sa Pagbangon, aimed to help the residents of Barangay Kambing generate income from native handmade products, was also launched along with the inauguration of its building.

The livelihood program intends to amplify the comprehensive ELAC efforts of the government in improving the socio-economic situation of the community.

“The LSIP, together with the convergence of our partner stakeholders, aims to sustain the peace and development efforts of the 4th Marine Brigade in the 2nd District of Sulu. Such initiatives paved the way for the comprehensive integration into the local environment of our former ASG members in our area of operations,” Songano added.

“We need the Whole-of-the-Nation Approach in addressing the concerns of our former ASG members, and their dependents, to prevent them from returning to their old ways. As such, through the Local Social Integration Program, our collective efforts will effectively address the serious concerns on development, governance, and security,” said Lt. Col. Eduard Olaso, MBLT-7 commander. (PNA)
