**MANILA CITY** –  The Diocese of Novaliches has partnered with the Quezon City government and the private sector in boosting the vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).

Dubbed as the “QC Protektado” project, the undertaking was launched on Monday through the signing of the memorandum of cooperation at the Cathedral Shrine of the Good Shepherd Parish along Regalado Avenue, Fairview, Quezon City.

Under the agreement, the Novaliches diocese shall provide venue, facility, and supporting manpower through its parishes within its jurisdiction and volunteers; propagate educational campaign about the Covid-19 vaccine, and communicate with the parishes and communities on the vaccination program.

On the other hand, the Quezon City Health Department shall ensure the availability of safe, effective, and free Covid-19 vaccines; provide guidelines, direct supervision, and documentation before, during, and post vaccination program; and give medical manpower when necessary.

The Far Eastern University-Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation (FEU-NRMF) shall provide professional manpower support and mentoring; storage of the vaccine in its facility; and complementary support to the local government's information campaign.

Pharmaceutical giant Unilab will be an enabler for the participation of healthcare partners and other institutions in the vaccination activities, apart from its support in logistics and communication.

The memorandum was signed by Novaliches Bishop Roberto Gaa, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte, FEU-NRMF chief operating officer Juan Enrique Reyes, and Unilab vice president for vaccine initiative Manuel Montinola.

The multi-stakeholder partnership will benefit the residents of areas within the diocese which includes the city's second, third, fifth and sixth legislative districts.

Meanwhile, Rev. Fr. Antonio Labiao Jr., vicar general for pastoral affairs of the diocese of Novaliches, is hoping that the project will encourage other groups to enter into such an agreement for the benefit of the people.

“May this inspire other LGUs and private groups to launch similar partnerships as this is an ideal public and private collaboration that ultimately benefits those who need it the most in this time of the pandemic. This is in line with the commitment of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) to transform church facilities in the country into Covid-19 vaccination sites and assist the government in allaying the public’s fear of getting vaccinated," he added.
