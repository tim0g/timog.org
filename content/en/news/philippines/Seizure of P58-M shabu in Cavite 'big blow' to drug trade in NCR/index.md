**MANILA CITY** –  The recent seizure of PHP58 million worth of shabu and the arrest of five drug suspects in Imus, Cavite will help cripple the operations of illegal drug syndicates in the National Capital Region (NCR), the Philippine National Police (PNP) said on Tuesday.

“I commend the operating units that made this drug operation a success. This shows that the cooperation between the PNP and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in stopping the proliferation of illegal drugs remains unwavering,” PNP chief, Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said in a statement.

The buy-bust operation conducted by the Manila Police District (MPD) Drug Enforcement Unit in coordination with the PDEA, the Cavite Provincial Police Office, and the Imus Municipal Police Station in Barangay Bayan Luma III, Imus, Cavite on June 19 resulted in the arrest of suspects Tamano Daud, Ismael Daud, Norma Maguid, Bainor Maguid, and Omar Rediya.

Seized from them were 8.533 kilograms of shabu worth PHP58.024 million, a Glock 17 9mm pistol, a Kossnor London Chrome .45 caliber pistol, assorted ammunition, and drug paraphernalia.

Eleazar said that the five suspects have been charged with violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 as well as illegal possession of firearms and ammunition.

The five suspects were identified as members of the Tamano Drug Group, which supplies narcotics to the National Capital Region and Rizal province, and are said to have connections with former Talitay, Maguindanao mayor Montasir Sabal, who is on the government's 'narco list'.

Sabal was killed after grabbing the service firearm of a police escort while en route to Camp Crame, Quezon City on the early hours of June 17, following his arrest at the Batangas Port on the night of June 16.

Sabal was also a supplier of firearms and explosive materials to the local terror group Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. (PNA)
