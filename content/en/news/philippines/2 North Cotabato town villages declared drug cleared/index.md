**KIDAPAWAN CITY, North Cotabato** –  Two villages in Pikit, North Cotabato have been declared “drug cleared” by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) Region 12, local officials said Sunday.

Mayor Sumulong Sultan of Pikit said efforts of the local government unit to ensure that residents Damalasak and Punol are safe from the menace of illegal drugs paid off.

“Our efforts yielded good results, and credit should go to all stakeholders,” Sultan said after PDEA-12 Director Naravy Duquiatan declared the two villages as drug cleared.

“We are happy with this development,” Rubina Mangansakan, chairperson of Barangay Punol also said about the meeting with PDEA-12 officials held at the Pikit town hall on Sunday afternoon.

Duquiatan lauded the village and municipal officials as well as the barangay anti-drug advisory council for their efforts to clear the villages of illegal drugs.

Duquiatan issued the certificates of drug cleared barangays during the meeting, also attended by several stakeholders from the local government unit, police and military, and the provincial government.

She said screening, assessment, and deliberation by the PDEA-12 committee has been ongoing for other villages in Pikit and North Cotabato province. (PNA)
