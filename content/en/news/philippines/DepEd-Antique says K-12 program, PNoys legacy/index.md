**SAN JOSE DE BUENAVISTA, Antique** –  The Department of Education (DepEd) Antique Division has condoled with the family of the late president Benigno Simeon  Aquino III as it named the K to 12 program as one of his legacies.

Antique Division School Governance and Operations Division chief Evelyn Remo, in an interview Thursday, said the K to 12 program made Filipino students at par with their counterparts in other countries.

“Before the implementation of the K to 12 program, Filipinos, when they work abroad, were still required to study further in their host country because our curriculum then was only for 10 years,” she said.

The K to 12 increased the Philippine basic education to 12 years, which made our countrymen more qualified when they seek employment abroad.

Under the Aquino administration, she added that Republic Act Number 10157 or The Kindergarten Education Act was passed institutionalizing the Kindergarten Education into the Basic Education System.

“The Kindergarten Education Act made mandatory the kindergarten and it strengthened the Early Childhood Education,” she said.

It was during Aquino’s term that the Antique Division hired non-teaching personnel to assist school heads so that they could concentrate on the implementation of the K to 12 program and the Kindergarten Education Act.

“There were also school buildings that were constructed for the senior high school students,” she said.

Remo, however, was not able to give the total number of non-teaching personnel and school buildings that were constructed during the Aquino administration.

Training of teachers was conducted to enhance their teaching skills, she added.

Meanwhile, the Philippine flag at the Antique capitol ground was flown at half-mast as the provincial government headed by Governor Rhodora J. Cadiao and the residents mourn the death of Aquino. (PNA)
