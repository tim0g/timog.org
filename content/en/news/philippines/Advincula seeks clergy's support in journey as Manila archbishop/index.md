**MANILA CITY** –  Newly-installed Manila Archbishop Jose Cardinal Advincula on Thursday asked for the support of the members of the clergy and the faithful.

“As I start my ministry as Archbishop of Manila, I humbly plead with all the priests, consecrated persons, and the laity of the Archdiocese of Manila: Let me be a listening shepherd to you all, and let us learn from one another how to listen after the heart of Christ our Good Shepherd,” Advincula said in his first homily as the 33rd Archbishop of Manila during the installation rites at the Manila Cathedral.

He also thanked the people of the Capiz archdiocese and the Diocese of San Carlos in Negros Occidental for their support and for being with him while he was still the leader of the archdiocese.

“Before I end, let me thank the priests, consecrated persons, and laity of the Archdiocese of Capiz and of my first Diocese, San Carlos in Negros: thank you so much for teaching me to be a shepherd who listens. For 20 years of being your bishop, I tried to be a listening shepherd to you; yet, as you know well, there is still a lot that I should learn,” he added.

Advincula, meanwhile, believed that the occasion is of great significance to the history of the Catholic Church in the country.

“First, because as we celebrate the Year of St. Joseph, God has called yours truly, a clueless Joe from Capiz, to be the ninth Filipino Cardinal. Who would have thought? We all didn’t see it coming. Personally, I find it providential because I have a special devotion to St. Joseph. The second reason why it is historically significant is that - as we celebrate the 500 years of Christianity in the Philippines, God has given me to the Archdiocese of Manila as your new shepherd. Clearly, Missio ad Gentes sends me off with a mission: YOU ARE GIFTED TO GIVE; what could be more challenging than that?” Advincula said in his homily during his installation as the 33rd Archbishop of Manila at the Manila Cathedral.

He added that another reason is that the installation rites coincided with the 450th founding anniversary of the city of Manila.

“See, how significantly historic this day is for us in the Church, as Filipinos, and particularly as Manileños!” he added.

Papal Nuncio to the Philippines Archbishop Charles Brown led the eucharistic celebration together with Manila archbishop emeritus Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales and Cotabato archbishop emeritus Orlando Quevedo.

A total of 21 priests from the Capiz archdiocese and two siblings of Advincula also attended the ceremony which lasted for more than two hours.

Local government officials from the cities of Manila, Makati, Mandaluyong, Pasay, and San Juan, which are all under the Archdiocese of Manila, are among the attendees.

On the other hand, Manila auxiliary bishop Broderick Pabillo, who was the Apostolic Administrator of Manila for more than a year welcomed Advincula to Manila.

“We are happy to have you with us. We recognize that you are a gift of the Church through our Holy Father, Pope Francis, to our local church. We have been praying for a shepherd for the past 15 trying months. At last, our prayers have been answered and you are now with us. I express the sentiments of joyous welcome of the archdiocese – the clergy, the consecrated people and the lay faithful. We know that you will have to adjust to the situation of leading a big urban archdiocese,” he said. (PNA)
