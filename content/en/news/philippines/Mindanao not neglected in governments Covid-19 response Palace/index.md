**MANILA CITY** –  Malacañang on Tuesday said the national government has prioritized areas classified as having high cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the distribution of vaccines.

This, as Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque disputed Deputy Speaker Rufus Rodriguez' claims that the national government has neglected Mindanao in its Covid-19 response, particularly the vaccine distribution in the region.

In a press briefing, Roque attributed the surge in coronavirus infections to low compliance with health protocols in parts of Visayas and Mindanao.

Roque also noted that stricter quarantine classifications, such as the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) and modified ECQ (MECQ), were not implemented in these areas with Covid-19 case spikes.

"Mayroon pong mga datos na nagpapakita na kaya din nag-surge po sa ilang parte ng Pilipinas - sa Visayas and Mindanao, eh kasi hindi nag-ECQ, hindi nag-MECQ. At talagang bumaba po ang compliance with the minimum health protocols (There are also data showing why cases surged in other parts of the Philippines – in Visayas and Mindanao, is because of non-implementation of ECQ and MECQ. And compliance with the minimum health protocols also dropped)," he said.

He emphasized the government has been pushing for an equitable distribution of the Covid-19 jabs nationwide.

He highlighted that around 38 percent of the country's vaccine supply was distributed to Metro Manila and surrounding areas, adding that the remaining balance will be delivered to the rest of the Philippines.

"So hindi po totoo iyan na ginipit natin ang ibang parte ng Pilipinas, hindi po. Inuna lang natin iyong una na pinakamataas ang numero, pero ngayong tumataas po sa iba, nagpapadala rin tayo ng karagdagang bakuna sa mga lugar na iyan (So it is not true that other parts of the Philippines are neglected. We are just giving priority to areas with high cases, but now other areas also increased, we also sent additional vaccines)," he said.

He reminded the public to adhere to public health measures to prevent the further spread of Covid-19.

"At saka ang pagkalat po ng sakit, hindi po iyan dahil sa kawalan ng bakuna, iyan po ay dahil bumaba ang compliance with minimum health requirements. Mask, hugas, iwas pa rin (And the increase of infections, it is not due to lack of vaccines, it is because of low compliance with minimum health requirements. Still wear face mask, proper hygiene, and physical distancing)," he said.

During a briefing of the House Committee on Mindanao Affairs, Rodriguez hit vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. for his supposed lack of priority in addressing the uptick in Covid-19 cases in Mindanao, as his letter of request for additional supply of Covid-19 vaccines for his constituents in Cagayan de Oro and other parts of the region was ignored.
