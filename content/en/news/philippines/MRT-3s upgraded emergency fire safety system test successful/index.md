**MANILA CITY** –  The functional testing of the upgraded fire detection and alarm system of the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT-3) was successful, the rail management said on Tuesday.

In a Facebook post, the MRT-3 said the functional testing of its newly refilled carbon dioxide (CO2) tanks that connect to the powerhouse of every station and signaling room, has so far been completed.

“Katatapos lang ng matagumpay na functional testing, o pag-alam kung gumagana at walang aberya ang mga bagong refilled na CO2 tanks sa CO2 room sa mga istasyon ng MRT-3 (We have just completed the successful functional testing or to determine whether the newly refilled CO2 tanks in the CO2 room of the MRT-3 stations are working well or have problems),” it said.

The MRT-3 said the CO2 tanks serve as a fire extinguisher in case smoke or fire is detected.

It added that a well-functioning CO2 room is a critical part of fire detection and alarm system to ensure accidents-free line operation and the safety of the passengers.

“Ang upgrading ng safety and security systems ay bahagi ng malawakan at komprehensibong rehabilitasyon ng MRT-3, sa direktiba ni DOTr [Department of Transportation] Secretary Art Tugade (The upgrading of safety and security systems is part of the massive and comprehensive rehabilitation of the MRT-3, based on the directive of DOTr Secretary Tugade),” the MRT-3 said.
