**LEGAZPI CITY** –  Police arrested a New People’s Army (NPA) rebel facing murder and illegal possession of firearms and ammunition charges in Sitio Camagong, Barangay San Ramon in Donsol, Sorsogon on Thursday.

Brig. Gen. Jonnel Estomo, Police Regional Office 5 regional director, identified the suspect as Jesus Macinas, 63.

In a statement, he said Macinas was collared by virtue of an arrest warrant issued by Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 53 Judge Rofebar Gerona on Nov. 27, 2019, without bail recommended.

He was also convicted on charges of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition before the sala of RTC Branch 52 Maximo Ables in Sorsogon City on April 21, with PHP200,000 bail recommended.

Macinas, who is an active member of the NPA Larangan 1 KP3, resisted arrest, drew his bolo and pointed a gun at the arresting team.

The operatives, however, shot the rebel on the leg that led to his arrest. He was brought to the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital.

Confiscated from Macinas' possession were a 24-inch bolo, a .38 caliber revolver, and a hand grenade. (PNA)
