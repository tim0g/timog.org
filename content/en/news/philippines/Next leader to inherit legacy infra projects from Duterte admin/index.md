**MANILA CITY** – The present administration will be leaving legacy infrastructure projects to the next leadership when President Rodrigo Duterte ends his term in 2022, Presidential Adviser for Flagship Programs Vivencio Dizon said.

In a press conference on Friday, Dizon said 119 projects amounting to over PHP4.7 trillion are currently on the revised list of infrastructure flagship projects of the government.

Eleven of these projects amounting to PHP127 billion are already completed, with 29 projects costing PHP238 billion set to be delivered next year, Dizon reported.

He added that there are 51 ongoing projects with a cost of PHP3.3 trillion to be completed in 2023 and beyond, while there are 28 big-ticket projects amounting to PHP1.1 trillion in the pipeline.

“Not only they will be giving a legacy of completed projects by the time President Duterte ends (his term) in 2022, but they will also be leaving behind a legacy of projects, big-ticket projects that are ready to go,” Dizon said.

The administration’s “Build, Build, Build” program has also completed 212 airport projects, 446 seaport projects, 10,376 flood mitigation structures, 26,494 kilometers of road, and 5,555 bridges throughout the country, he added.

He said ongoing projects consist of 102 airport projects, 117 seaport projects, 1,090 kilometers of railway, 2,587 flood mitigation structures, 2,515 kilometers of road, and 1,020 bridges.

“We are very happy to report that despite all the challenges, including this once in century pandemic that has wreaked havoc throughout the entire world including our own country, we have achieved so much and we will continue to achieve more in the future,” Dizon said.

In the coming weeks, the government will be inaugurating projects under “Build, Build, Build” such as the Light Rail Transit-2 (LRT-2) extension project by next week, China-funded Estrella-Pantaleon Bridge in the next two weeks, and the Clark International Airport new passenger terminal building next month.
