**ANGELES CITY, Pampanga** –  The city government here is eyeing to open its third vaccination site to hasten the inoculation of residents against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).

Mayor Carmelo Lazatin Jr. on Thursday said the planned third vaccination area will be at the Sapalibutad Elementary School which is expected to serve 1,000 Angeleños per day.

Last week, the Angeles City National High School in Barangay Pampang was designated as the city's second Covid-19 vaccination site.

Last March, Lazatin designated the City College of Angeles (CCA) as its first Covid-19 vaccination center.

To date, the city government is conducting inoculation to priority groups A1 or health workers, A2 (elderly), A3 comprising persons with comorbidities or those with existing health conditions, and A4 or frontline personnel in essential sectors including uniformed personnel and those in working sectors identified by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Vaccination records show that as of June 16, a total of 27,673 Angeleños from the priority groups have received their first shot of vaccines, while 5,070 have completed their two doses.

A total of 6,615 people under priority group A1 received their first dose of vaccine, while 4,317 were already fully-vaccinated; 8,503 for the first dose in A2, 262 for the second dose; 11,726 under A3 priority group received the first dose, while 491 also got the second dose; and 829 personnel from A4 got their first shot of vaccine.

The vaccines administered -- Astrazeneca and Sinovac -- were donated by the Department of Health (DOH).

Meanwhile, Lazatin received his second dose of Sinovac on Wednesday.

"I am encouraging everyone to get vaccinated and be part of the solution. This will protect you and your loved ones against the virus," he said in an official social media post.

The mayor also urged Angeleños to register for the Covid-19 vaccination at angelescity.gov.ph, and participate in the household survey being conducted in the 33 barangays by teams deployed by the city government.

As of June 16, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the city is 6,278 with 340 total active cases. The total number of recoveries is 5,653 while the total number of deaths is 285. (PNA)
