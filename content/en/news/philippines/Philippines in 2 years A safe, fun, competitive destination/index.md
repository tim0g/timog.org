**MANILA CITY** –   For the next two years, the Philippines will be positioned as a “safe, fun, and competitive" destination, the Department of Tourism (DOT) said Thursday as it banks on strong partnerships with communities and visitors.

The DOT said it would develop more tourism products that focus on nature and culture while continuing its "safe travel" campaign to ingrain world-recognized health and hygiene protocols in every Philippine destination.

The statement came as the agency noted a 61.2 percent decrease in the tourism contribution to the Philippine economy last year as the pandemic hit hard the industry.

Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that the Tourism Direct Gross Value Added (TDGVA) dropped to PHP973.31 billion last year from PHP2.51 trillion in 2019.

This is only 5.4 percent of the industry’s contribution to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), a steep decline from 12.8 percent in 2019, the agency said.

More than the losses in tourism arrivals and revenue, it added that these also translate to millions of tourism workers who lost their jobs.

"Admittedly, a setback in an industry that was flourishing before the Covid-19 pandemic, the dismal figures reflect the gargantuan challenge that the DOT and the entire tourism industry is faced today," the DOT said.

"For an industry highly dependent on the mobility and face-to-face interaction of people, the severe damage of the global pandemic crisis is both unprecedented and unavoidable," it added.

The agency said it would explore "all means possible" to facilitate the gradual recovery and reopening of the tourism industry while it also adheres to government restrictions.

Under its Tourism Response and Recovery Plan, the agency said its thrust is focused on the following:

1. Ensure protection of jobs and safety of tourism workers, visitors, and communities;

2. Support the recovery of tourism enterprises; and

3. Rebuild confidence and grow demand in the domestic and foreign market.

"The DOT is optimistic that this transient situation will soon be over and that with the collective effort of the private and public sectors, the Philippine tourism industry will emerge bigger, better, and more resilient in the new normal," it said. (PNA)
