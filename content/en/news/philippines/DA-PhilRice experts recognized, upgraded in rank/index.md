**MANILA CITY** –  Scientists of the Department of Agriculture-Philippine Rice Research Institute (DA-PhilRice) have received honors for their significant contributions in enriching the body of knowledge on rice science.

On Friday, the DA posted that Dr. Reynante L. Ordonio, Scientist I, was distinguished as the 2021 Outstanding Young Scientist (OYS) in the field of Agricultural Science by the National Academy of Science and Technology.

Earlier, the 40-year old scientist joined the public service as a researcher specializing in molecular breeding. His research works were published in Science, Nature Cell Research and Scientific Reports, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences-USA. DA said that these are considered high-impact journals in their field of study.

Ordonio now leads the Healthier Rice Project at DA-PhilRice, a big-ticket project that applies modern biotechnology in breeding high beta carotene rice (Golden Rice) and high iron and zinc rice. He also leads the first rice gene-editing project in the Institute, funded by the DA-Biotech Program Office.

Ordonio has recently made a major contribution in crafting the country’s first policy on the assessment of products of New Plant Breeding Techniques that includes gene editing as chair of the ad hoc technical working group under the National Committee on Biosafety of the Philippines.

"This will eventually have an impact on international trade and will facilitate modern biotech research in the country," DA said.

The OYS is awarded to young Filipino scientists under 41 years old, who have made significant contributions to science and technology.

On the other hand, Dr. Roel R. Suralta, also an OYS awardee in 2010, was promoted as Career Scientist III by the Scientific Career Council. He is the only career scientist to date with the said rank in the Institute.

DA profiled Suralta as a multi-awarded scientist who specializes in environmental stress physiology and root developmental biology. He is also a recipient of the 2013 Presidential Lingkod Bayan Award given by the Civil Service Commission (CSC).

His papers on root plasticity in rice are published in top-tier journals and have hundreds of citations from researchers in the Philippines and abroad.

His studies, which were implemented with his colleagues from DA-PhilRice, International Rice Research Institute, Nagoya University, and other local and international agencies, have far offered new perspectives on rice root adaptation in abiotic stress-prone growing-environments affected by climate change.

"The Scientific Career System deals with the recruitment, career progression, recognition, and reward of scientists in the public service as a means of developing a pool of highly qualified and productive scientific personnel. The system is co-implemented by the CSC and Department of Science and Technology," the DA said.

There are only 12 active career scientists in DA-PhilRice including Ordonio and Suralta. (PNA)
