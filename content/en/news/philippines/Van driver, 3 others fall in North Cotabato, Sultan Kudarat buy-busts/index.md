**KIDAPAWAN CITY** – Anti-narcotics operatives arrested a van driver and three others in separate anti-drug operations in North Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat on Sunday.

In Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat, agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in Region 12 nabbed the three suspects along the national highway in Purok Mabinuligon, Barangay Saliao, Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat at 10 a.m.

In a report, PDEA-12 Director Naravy Duquiatan identified the suspects as Nelson Abpi, 43, van driver, of Shariff Aguak, Maguindanao; Abusama Sali, 48, of Rosary Heights, Cotabato City; and Abonawas Mamoro, 44, of Seneguelas St., Dadiangas East, General Santos City.

“The suspects were arrested when a PDEA agent posed as a buyer was able to transact six sachets of suspected shabu weighing more or less five grams from the suspects,” Duquiatan said.

The seized shabu has an estimated value of PHP34,000, she added.

Duquiatan said Abpi and his cohorts have been involved in the distribution of illegal drugs in Sultan Kudarat province and other nearby areas in the region.

Meanwhile, in Pikit, North Cotabato, PDEA agents also nabbed Marjamie Mamasaunda, 30, after he sold illegal drugs to an undercover agent at Datu Piang St., Barangay Poblacion at 1:30 p.m.

Mamasunda yielded PHP5,000 worth of shabu.

"Mamasaunda is a PDEA-12 high-value target," Duquiatan said.

She said the suspects were charged for violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. (PNA)
