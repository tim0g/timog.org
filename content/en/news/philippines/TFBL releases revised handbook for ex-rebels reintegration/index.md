**MANILA CITY** –  The Task Force Balik Loob (TFBL) has released the second edition of the Former Rebel Reintegration Handbook which now includes former violent extremists (FVEs) as beneficiaries of the Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP).

TFBL chair and Defense Undersecretary Reynaldo B. Mapagu said the second edition of the handbook will serve as a guide for the implementation of E-CLIP, which is designed to provide holistic and pro-active assistance to former rebels (FRs) and FVEs.

“We have to continue informing and empowering our E-CLIP implementers so that the beneficiaries of the program will be assisted more effectively in their transition to mainstream society,” he said in a statement Sunday.

Mapagu added that the handbook embodies the existing implementing rules and regulations as well as guidelines for the different partner agencies for the total reintegration of former rebels who have decided to return to the fold of the law.

“Unlike previous integration programs for former rebels, E-CLIP emphasizes individual assistance suited for the needs of the beneficiaries, community development through PAMANA (Payapa at Masaganang Pamayanan) program, and the participation of non-government organizations," he added.

Through the revised handbook, Mapagu said E-CLIP implementers on the ground will have a valuable resource and reference for the specific aid or process that can be undertaken for FRs and FVEs.

The E-CLIP was the outcome of the directive issued by President Rodrigo R. Duterte that provides for shelter, employment, and livelihood assistance, as well as an effective monitoring and evaluation system, for former members of the New People’s Army (NPA).

The FVEs were included as beneficiaries of the E-CLIP through Administrative Order No. 25, series of 2020.

The handbook is a working document and will be updated when deemed necessary to respond to the changing environment or situation, such as benefits given by the different agencies, as agreed upon mutually by all concerned parties.

The E-CLIP is the government’s flagship program for the reintegration of former rebels and former violent extremists into mainstream society. (PNA)
