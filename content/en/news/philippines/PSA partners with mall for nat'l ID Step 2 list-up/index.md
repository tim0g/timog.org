**CITY OF MALOLOS, Bulacan** – The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) has partnered with SM City Baliwag for the Step 2 registration of the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys).

Mall information officer Nica Cunanan, in an interview on Friday, said all registrants with appointment slips or Application Reference Number (ARN) and notified by PSA via text message may now proceed to the PhilSys Registration Center located at the Cyberzone area.

As one of PSA's mall registration partners for the national ID, she said SM City Baliwag and PSA have put up detailed signages showing systematic procedures for a smooth and orderly manner of registration.

She noted that the PhilSys Step 2 registration process includes validation of appointment slips and supporting documents, verification of demographic information, capturing of biometric information such as iris scan, fingerprint and front-facing photo, and issuance of the transaction slip.

After completing the Step 2 process, registrants will be given a PhilSys Number (PSN). The ID will then be delivered to the registrant’s chosen address via mail.

"To ensure public safety, SM City Baliwag, in partnership with PSA, adhere to strict implementation of the standard health and safety protocols set by the IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force) and DOH (Department of Health)," Cunanan said.

"Registrants will be requested to observe a safe distance, especially when queuing. SM City Baliwag also assigned security and disinfection team for crowd management and maintaining sanitation protocols," she said.

PhilSys Step 2 Registration at SM City Baliwag will last for a year, and target to accommodate at least 250 registrants per day.

For safety and convenience, registrants may register online through https://register.philsys.gov.ph/.

Following SM City Baliwag, the PSA is yet to announce the starting date of the PhilSys Step 2 registration at SM Center Pulilan, one of its assigned registration centers in the first district of Bulacan.

Signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte in August 2018, Republic Act 11055, or the Philippine Identification System Act, aims to establish a single national ID for all Filipinos and resident aliens.

The national ID shall be a valid proof of identity that will be a means of simplifying public and private transactions, enrollment in schools, and the opening of bank accounts.

It will also boost efficiency, especially in dealing with government services where people will only need to present one ID during transactions. (PNA)
