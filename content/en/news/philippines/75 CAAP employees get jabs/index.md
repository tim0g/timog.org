**MANILA CITY** â€“  An initial 75 employees of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) got vaccinated against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) at the Mall of Asia giga hub on Friday.

The front-liners included Security and Intelligence Service staff and airport workers, such as medical teams attending to passengers, CAAP spokesperson Eric Apolonio told the Philippine News Agency in an interview.

"(This initiative) was done in partnership with the local government unit of Pasay. Our OFSAM (Office of the Flight Surgeon and Aviation Medicine) coordinated with them," he said.

Apolonio said CAAP employees in other airports nationwide are also encouraged to get inoculated.

He said most central office employees are already registered and waiting for their schedules.

Apolonio said they remember three of their co-workers who succumbed to Covid-19.

"It is important for those working in the aviation sector to be inoculated. Front-liners need to be protected. Protection is not just for themselves but also for their families," he said. (PNA)
