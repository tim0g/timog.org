**MANILA CITY** –  Outstanding Manilenyos were honored on the eve of the 450th Araw ng Maynila held at the Metropolitan Theater on Wednesday.

Manila Mayor Francisco ‘Isko Moreno’ Domagoso led the awarding ceremony on Wednesday evening.

“Napakahalaga ng araw na ito sa kadahilanang ating bibigyang parangal ang mga natatanging mamayan ng ating dakilang lungsod. Mga Batang Maynila na nagbuhos ng kanilang lakas, talino at panahon upang manguna sa bokasyon na kanilang kinabibilangan (This is a very important day as we will honor the most outstanding residents of our city. These are Manilans who dedicated they strength, time, and skills to be the best in their fields),” Domagoso said.

Domagoso also thanked National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) through its Chairman Nick Lizaso for allowing the city to use the Metropolitan Theatre also known as the “The Grand Old Dame of Manila” for the very special occasion.

He also assured the leadership of the city’s utmost support to the goal of restoring the country's artistic and cultural center in the nation’s capital.

Among those given recognition as 'Oustanding Manilans' are the following:

Chairman Ann Kristine Abella (Barangay Affairs)

Ralph De Sagon (Culture and the Arts)

Dharyl Del Mundo (Education)

Beethoven Bunagan (Entertainment)

Hon. Josefina Siscar (Judiciary)

Police Lt. Col. John Guiagui (Law Enforcement)

Wilbur Arimboyutan (Prosecution Service)

Dr. David Pinto (Public Health)

Chiang Kai Shek College Alumni Association, Inc. (Socio-Civic Organization)

Carlos Edriel Yulo (Sports)

Meanwhile, Dr. Maria Lydia Bautista received the Rajah Sulayman Award while the Gat Andres Bonifacio Award was awarded to Francisco Sionil José.

Domagoso also honored those who served in the frontline in the city’s fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).

“Atin ding kikilalanin nang may pagmamalaki ang mga kawani ng pamahalaang lungsod na sa katapatan nila at pagganap sa kanilang sinumpaang mga tungkulin ay naging dahilan ng kanilang pagpanaw. Mga kawani na di alintana ang panganib sa kanilang propesyon (We also honor government employees who showed honesty and who in the performance of their duty, sacrificed their lives. Frontliners who disregarded the risk in the name of their sworn profession),” he said.

These front-liners, Domagoso said, served as the city’s partner in this time of the Covid-19 pandemic.

A moment of silence was also offered to honor the fallen front-liners as 18 of them were given the posthumous award.

Meanwhile, top business taxpayers and top real property taxpayers for the year 2020 were also recognized during the event.

On Thursday, the 450th celebration of Araw ng Maynila, the city government has prepared various activities that include wreath-laying ceremonies at the Rizal Monument, Rajah Sulayman, and the San Agustin Church.

There will also be a presentation and launching of a commemorative stamp by the Philippine Postal Corporation and the Museo Pambata.

Finally, the celebration will be capped with the inauguration of the Manila Covid-19 Field Hospital at the Rizal Park. (PNA)
