**MANILA CITY** –  The United Nations (UN) has extolled former President Benigno Aquino III for his contribution and services to the Philippines as it joins the nation in mourning the latter's death on Thursday.

In a statement, UN Philippines Resident Coordinator Gustavo Gonzalez said: "On behalf of the United Nations, I extend our heartfelt condolences to Mr. Aquino’s family and friends."
 
"We join the Filipino people in honoring his contribution and services to the country," he said.
 
The UN Philippines also attached a photo of Aquino when he spoke before the 65th UN General Assembly in 2010.
 
Back then, Aquino said the Philippines would not stay entirely dependent on “the largess of the developed world”, but, in fact, would be active in its own development through its efforts in the Group of 77 and initiatives to enhance South-South cooperation and collective economic interests.
 
Under his presidency, the Philippines also initiated and overwhelmingly won an arbitration case against China's excessive claims in the South China Sea.
 
Pursued within the framework of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the government said the 2016 landmark ruling has now become part of the international law to settle issues of historic rights and maritime entitlements in the South China Sea.
 
Tributes further poured in from members of the diplomatic community in the Philippines who expressed their heartfelt sympathies to the nation and the bereaved family of Aquino.
 
Norwegian Ambassador Bjørn Jahnsen said the Embassy is always thankful for the partnership between Norway and the Philippines under his term.
 
"On behalf of the Norwegian Embassy in Manila, I offer our deepest condolences to former President Benigno Aquino III’s family and loved ones at this difficult time. We are saddened by President Aquino’s passing and will always be thankful for our partnership," he said over Twitter.

The Czech Embassy Manila, on the other hand, hailed the agreements reached between the two nations during his presidency, particularly on culture and education.
 
"The Czech Embassy Manila wishes to express its deepest condolences to the Filipino people and to the bereaved family of the late former President Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III," it said.
 
"New cultural agreement(s) to strengthen cooperation in the field of culture, education, science, and sports were signed during his term and he also welcomed former First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic, Mr. Karel Schwarzenberg in 2012," it added.
 
Meanwhile, the Malaysian Embassy in Manila sent its condolences through Twitter.
 
"The Embassy of Malaysia is deeply saddened by the demise of His Excellency Benigno Simeon Cojuangco Aquino, III the 15th President of the Republic of the Philippines," it said.
