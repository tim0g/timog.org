No one gets rich from working 12 hours a day; not in a capitalist oppressed country.

In 2015, during Rodrigo Duterte’s Mayoral term in Davao City, expressed his strong disapproval of contractualization or endo (end of contract) in  the country and that he would refuse to run a country with such practice of illegally hiring fixed-term employees to prevent the company from granting regular worker benefits. He also threatened his opposition to defeat him in presidential elections if they are against his anti-contractualization campaigns. Along with this, he also pledged to overturn the country’s unreasonable labor conditions.

Duterte’s promises for the poor Filipinos turned out to be campaign bravado as it crumbled just exactly how he crumpled in front of bigtime capitalists just to desperately please them. Shamelessly kissing the foot of capitalism, his once promising words unravel his anti-poor agenda, to brutally terminate the marginalized.

On June 1, a post rapidly spread on the internet showing a [customer’s complaints after receiving a “fried towel”](https://www.rappler.com/business/jollibee-closes-bgc-branch-days-fried-towel-incident-june-2021) after ordering a fried chicken from a well-known fast food giant, Jollibee. The customer, Alique Perez, expressed her dismay online, calling out the restaurant’s negligence and insanitary food preparation which may cause harm and health issues to their consumers. She called it disgusting and an embarrassing service, because of the filthy incident, the  Jollibee Bonifacio Stop-over branch was ordered to close for three days and may be facing a P100,000 fine and one-month suspension of operations on its first offense under Republic Act No.10611, the Food Safety Act .

Due to the wide reach of the viral post, people began to divide. Some defended the customer for publicly calling out the food mishandling incident while some defended the Jollibee management, specifically their employees. However, it must also put into the context that these mistakes are often results of the rotting issue of labor abuse: the ironic plight of service crews, juggling in-between underpayment and overworking conditions, with the irreversible dangers from job orders.

In April 2018, Jollibee received an order from DOLE (Department of Labor and Employment) to grant over 6,000 contractual workers their regularization and to refund the P15 million illegally collected payments to its 426 workers from “Coop Share, Coop Christmas Paluwagan Fund, and Coop Savings Fund.”  Aside from this, over P4 Million illegal wage deductions, donations, shares, and other illegal payment collections were ordered to be refunded to 412 Jollibee workers. Also, in May of the same year, Jollibee Corporation was listed by DOLE as the top corporation with the largest number of contractualized employment in the Philippines with a total of 14,960 fixed-term affected employees, according to data released by the said department.

However, despite DOLE’s order, the food corporation refused to obey the order and ended up illegally  terminating workers which led to a mass protest of Samahang Manggagawa Jollibee Foods Corporation (SM-JFC) in June, 2018.The corporation’s labor-only unfair agreement and without regularization are still being endured by Filipinos due to their fear of unemployment which is more problematic. Filipinos tolerate unfair treatment and salary without benefits yet continuously being abused and taken advantage of with their manpower without a clear picture of regularization. 

Duterte repeatedly delayed and missed the deadline of the signing of  the Executive Order against Endo which holds stricter provisions regarding the end-of-contract scheme. It clearly shows his unprofessionalism and carelessness in the laborers’ situation. The consecutive delays contrasted with his 2015 statement, where he promised to prioritize the poor.  Frustrated with the year-long waiting to be heard and be seriously addressed, workers then called out the administration’s silence on this issue despite the yearning employees who have been robbed by unfair capitalist employers.

In the end, July 2019, Duterte betrayed the Filipino people and trashed the rights and hopes of Filipino workers after vetoing the EO against ant-endo. As he chose to side with capitalists, he abandoned his fellow Filipinos and slapped them with the fact that their elected leader is a greedy and selfish liar who used their struggles to gain power, recognition and alliance with capitalists.

Duterte fed Filipinos with lies and a propagandistic approach playing-hero to the marginalized, giving them false hope through showers of system reforms for Filipino benefits. His empty words captured the hearts of the hopeless who are desperate to escape from the ties of poverty.


These promises blinded millions of Filipino people; deceived by these pretentious words of hope that he would and could help them out from poverty and would give them a safe and promising life, unfortunately, he only brought chaos and nightmares to the people. Duterte eventually showed his true colors after being elected to the presidency, exposing all of his promises as lies and mere propaganda, disregarding the main goal of leadership, to protect and uphold people’s rights and welfare. His obsession with power and capitalism also arises, voiding all his said plans to prioritize the poor and those who are trapped in poverty.

The recurring deprivation of laborers produces more aggressive employees, desperate for contract renewal to experience the rights, benefits, and salary that they longly deserve. Capitalists’ refusal to absorb workers proves selfishness and unfairness as they demand for  efficient workers’ services yet practice exploitation of the workforce. 


Duterte, being a puppet of Capitalists and dogs of foreign companies, continuously sniffing the butts of large companies, disregarding fair rights and benefits of Filipinos.  His choice to swallow his toxic lies and choose to bow down on capitalists is one of the reasons why Filipinos are still being dragged by poverty. Too much work demands and abusive work loads but with a salary of a pinch amount, enabling capitalists to pay less for the same manpower, and economic development established by workers.

Jollibee is not that “jolly” after all,  for  decades of labor rights suppression inside the corporation and after milking their workers to gain economic profit, fattening comfortably seated capitalists. “Bida and saya” never truly existed because if it does so, then no workers should have never endured the burden of being overworked but severely underpaid after long hours of daily work. Unappreciated, the “jolly crew” deserves the rightful pay and benefits for their efforts in giving plausible service because they really are the ones who bring joy to customers.

We should not only be mindful and concerned with the common and human mistakes, we should also be critical and delve deeper on much more serious issues which affect the majority such as abusive employment and companies that take advantage of people in need and people tied in poverty. We should also be vocal and outspokenly brave in calling out failed management, failed leadership, specifically the failed governance that drastically drags and buries people into poverty, enslaved by capitalism but gained nothing but oppression from their own elected leaders who deserted them. 

Workers should make use of their unjust situation to stir up one another to successfully break the enslaving chains of bourgeoisie. They as well should conquer the streets to fight back and proclaim that they shall no longer be controlled nor silenced by greedy employers. Workers are the real blood of the society and losing them is the greatest threat to the economist bureaucracy and employers know that workers’ collected rage is strong enough to demolish the whole capitalist industry.
