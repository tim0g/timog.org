**DUMAGUETE CITY** –  The Negros Oriental Electric Cooperative II (NORECO II) has announced a no disconnection policy, easy payment schemes and other measures to be undertaken during the modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) in Negros Oriental from June 16-30.

NORECO II information officer Sharon Araula, in a media release Wednesday, said online payment platforms, skeleton workforce, temporary suspension of disconnection activities, and electricity bills falling within the MECQ period without interest are among these measures.

Online payment platforms include Lazada, MyBudgetLoad Community, and fund transfer of payment to the NORECO II account number.

Applications for new connections and net metering may be processed for an extended period, while complaints may be coursed through the firm’s hotline numbers as it encourages limited face-to-face engagement.

For the actual meter reading, electricity bills will be distributed after the MECQ period, and the average reading based on the Magna Carta for Residential Electricity Consumers will be implemented if there is a refusal of entry for meter reading.

Another measure being adopted is the temporary suspension of disconnection activities for accounts due prior to the declaration of MECQ.

Disconnection activities for unpaid electricity bills prior to the declaration of the ECQ will resume after the lifting of this quarantine status.

Meanwhile, NORECO II announced that electricity bills falling due on June 16-30, 2021 have a grace period of 30 days without incurring interests, penalties, and other charges.

Any unpaid balance after the lapse of the 30-day grace period shall be payable in three equal monthly installments without incurring interests, penalties, and other charges, pursuant to the Energy Regulatory Commission advisory dated Oct. 29, 2020.

Other maintenance activities that can be deferred will be executed after the MECQ period but NORECO II reassures the public that its regular operations will continue. (PNA)
