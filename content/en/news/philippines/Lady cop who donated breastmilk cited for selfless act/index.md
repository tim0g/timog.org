**MANILA CITY** –  A policewoman who donated breastmilk to infants in need in Baguio City was lauded by Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Gen. Guillermo Eleazar Wednesday for her "selfless and kind" act.

Eleazar said Cpl. Aimarie Boadilla's gesture to provide breastmilk for infants whose mothers are unable to feed them or cannot lactate is a "unique" act of public service, as he lauded the police for going beyond the call of duty.

“Ipinakita ni Cpl. Boadilla na ang kagaya niya na isang nanay na pulis ay hindi makasarili at handang tumugon sa pangangailan ng kanyang kapwa (Cpl. Boadilla, a police officer and mother at the same time, showed unselfishness and readiness to help others)," he added.

Eleazar said he hoped that other police officers would be inspired by Boadilla’s service to others, even as he assured that the policewoman would be given due recognition for her good deed.

Several other female cops have been commended for their babysitting initiatives. Among them was M/Sgt. Catherine Surban of Virac in Catanduanes, who did not hesitate to breastfeed a baby while inside the police station.

Meantime, Eleazar warned police commanders to strictly abide by the Intensified Cleanliness Policy (ICP) in the workplace or face sanctions.

Eleazar issued the warning after the Internal Affairs Service sought an explanation from the commander of Police Station 1 in Mandaue City, Cebu for non-compliance with the ICP.

A surprise inspection by the IAS at the station last June 26 found a dirty police station, manned by an insufficient number of police personnel.

The team found inside the police station clothes hung to dry, an empty bottle of alcoholic beverage, improperly labeled garbage bins, and even dog poop.

Only four out of 45 personnel were present for the IAS inspection and even the station commander was not there at the time of the inspection.

The deputy station commander was present but he was "inattentive" and could not account for the number of personnel at the police station at the time of inspection.

The inspectors also noticed that the desk officer was not properly wearing his face mask and had no face shield.

The ICP in offices ensures that all police precincts and stations are kept clean and presentable which would reflect well on the policemen assigned there. (PNA)
