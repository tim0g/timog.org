**DAVAO CITY** –  High-risk behaviors of the ‘millennials’ were attributed to be a factor in the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases here, an official said Wednesday.

In a statement, Davao City Covid-19 Task Force focal person Dr. Michelle Schlosser identified the millennials as individuals aged 24 to 40 years old.

"We all know millennials, these are a population with high-risk behaviors. They love to socialize and since they are also part of the working group, they go out to socialize and interact. They are likely highly to get infected," she said.

Despite that, Schlosser, however, said the recovery rate is high among millennials.

"We have a high recovery rate in general. We have a lot of asymptomatic," she added.

Schlosser also noted that mortality is high among seniors due to their comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and immune-compromised.

Acting City Health Office Head Dr. Ashley Lopez, also said of the 21,453 total cases as of June 19, a total of 13,294 or about 62 percent infected were in the 20-29, 30-39, and 40-49 age groups which the millennials belong.

The 20-29 bracket, however, topped the list with the most Covid-19 infections with a total of 5,721 confirmed positive cases followed by the 30-39 group with 4,584 cases, in third came the 40-49 bracket with 2,989 confirmed positive Covid-19 cases.

The age groups of millennials also recorded 159 out of the 829 deaths as of June 19.

The city logged a 74.87 percent recovery rate or 16,061 from the total confirmed cases of 21,453 and 3.75 percent death rate with 829 since March 2020. (PNA)
