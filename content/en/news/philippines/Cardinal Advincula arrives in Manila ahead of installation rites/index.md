**MANILA CITY** â€“  Jose Cardinal Advincula is now in Manila two days before his scheduled installation as the new Archbishop of Manila.

In a Facebook post, the Archdiocese of Capiz said the Cardinal arrived on Tuesday afternoon at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 3 in Pasay City from Roxas City, Capiz.

He then proceeded to the Residencia del Arzobispo in Intramuros, Manila, where he was welcomed by Manila Apostolic Administrator Bishop Broderick Pabillo and the Board of Consultors of the Archdiocese of Manila.

Advincula will be installed as the new head of the archdiocese in a ceremony to be held on June 24 at 9 a.m. at the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros.

The installation Mass will be presided by Papal Nuncio to the Philippines Archbishop Charles Brown.

Pope Francis appointed the Cardinal to the position in March 2021, several months after he was elevated to the College of Cardinals.

Advincula's appointment as the 33rd Manila archbishop will result in the vacancy at the top post of the Capiz archdiocese. (PNA)
