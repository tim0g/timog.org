**MANILA CITY** –  The first locally run university in Quezon City received an institutional recognition from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).

Quezon City University (QCU) is now a full-fledged Higher Education Institution, offering the required programs to be classified as such.

Mayor Joy Belmonte said happiness is an understatement on how she feels about the recognition.

“Para tayong nasa langit dahil itong pinangarap natin sa napakatagal na panahon ay nasakatuparan sa araw na ito (It feels like heaven because our long-time dream has become a reality today),” Belmonte said during the awarding of the CHED recognition at the City Hall's Executive Lounge on Thursday.

CHED Chairperson Prospero de Vera and UniFAST (Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education) Executive Director Ryan Estevez awarded the recognition to QCU, represented by Belmonte.

“This CHED recognition is a testament to the quality of education that we provide in QCU. For years, we have continuously strived to provide improved higher education programs for our students that will prepare them as they join the workforce. We believe this achievement will open more opportunities for our QCians,” Belmonte said.

Formerly known as Quezon City Polytechnic, the school was established on March 1, 1994, starting with technical and vocational courses.

In 2001, it was renamed Quezon City Polytechnic University and in 2019, the city council passed Ordinance SP-2812 to make it QCU, as aligned with Republic Act 10931, or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act.

Currently, QCU offers degrees in Electronics Engineering, Entrepreneurship, Industrial Engineering, Information Technology, and Accountancy.

“I really felt na parang hindi tama na ang pinakamalaking siyudad sa buong NCR (National Capital Region) and in fact ang may pinakamaraming tao sa buong Pilipinas na lungsod, ang may pinakamaraming negosyo, ang kinikilalang (It doesn’t seem right that the biggest city in the NCR, the city with the biggest population in the country, with the most number of businesses, and recognized as) education capital because all the premier universities are in QC does not have its own locally run university,” Belmonte said.

Now, Belmonte said she feels challenged to offer more quality education for the students of QC.

QCU must also prove to CHED and to all stakeholders that it deserves the recognition, she added.

With the institutional recognition, full tuition fee and miscellaneous fees of the more than 8,000 qualified QCU scholars will be covered by CHED’s UniFAST program.

QCU students can also avail themselves of various CHED scholarships and financial assistance like Tertiary Education Subsidy, Student Loan Program, and "Tulong Dunong" program.

QCU president Dr. Theresita Atienza assured UniFAST they will continue to expand their program offerings and ensure that their graduates are equipped when they graduate. (PNA)
