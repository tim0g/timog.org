**ZAMBOANGA CITY** –  The local government on Monday rolled out free rides for senior citizens, people with disability, and those with comorbidities to and from vaccination sites.

The provision of free transportation is part of the efforts of the local government to ramp up coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccination in this city, Mayor Maria Isabelle Climaco-Salazar said.

Salazar said the City Health Office has opened selected vaccination centers on Monday to cater to the A1 (medical front-liners), A2 (senior citizens), and A3 (persons with comorbidities) priority groups who are eligible for Pfizer vaccines that were deployed to this city.

Two additional vaccination centers were also opened at the Western Mindanao Station University (WMSU) and the Ateneo de Zamboanga University (ADZU).

The Department of Health-9 (DOH-9) received on June 15 some 5,850 vials of Pfizer vaccines which is equivalent to 35,100 doses as one vial is equivalent to six doses.

Dr. Augusto Manolo Alpichi, DOH-9 assistant director, earlier said the Pfizer vaccines will be solely utilized in this city since it needs special handling to be transported to the different provinces in the region.

The Pfizer vaccines are intended for first and second doses, which means an additional 17,550 new recipients of the government’s vaccination program.

Meanwhile, Dr. Aaron Jess Khalil Curay, DOH-9 media officer, appealed to all individuals who already received their first dose of Covid-19 to get their second dose as scheduled.

Curay made the call as they noted that some individuals have failed to appear in the vaccination sites to get their second dose of vaccines. (PNA)
