**CITY OF MALOLOS, BULACAN** –   The ongoing simultaneous rehabilitation of two old bridges in this province by the NLEX Corporation has gained support from local officials.

Meycauayan City Mayor Linabelle Villarica said on Wednesday they can all expect a better travel experience after the project’s completion in the third quarter of this year. 

“We seek the patience and understanding of the public as the lane closures are necessary to ensure everyone's safety while the rehabilitation of the Meycauayan Bridge is being completed,” she said in a statement.

Last April, NLEX Corporation started the rehabilitation of the bridges which includes replacement of girders and slabs to strengthen the structures and improve their lifespan.

The rehabilitation of the 45-meter Meycauayan bridge and 64-meter Bigaa bridge in Balagtas will be completed in September and August 2021, respectively.

Bocaue Mayor Jose Santiago Jr., said “these two bridges have been vital in facilitating safe and unimpeded travel of motorists and transport of goods in and out of the expressway. We are optimistic that once the rehabilitation is completed, we can expect a better travel experience.”

At present, three lanes have remained passable to motorists while works are ongoing in the bridges.

Counterflow is also being implemented as needed. Traffic marshals and patrol crews are deployed on-site to manage the traffic flow and assist motorists.

For his part, Governor Daniel Fernando said “we extend support to their important infrastructure developments that will improve the serviceability of our expressway, strengthen connectivity, boost investment and open up job opportunities in the province of Bulacan.”

NLEX Corporation president and general manager J. Luigi L. Bautista assured the public that efforts are being exerted to ensure motorists' safety and reduce traffic congestion.

He is also elated over the support of the local stakeholders in areas covered by the project.

“We are very pleased and grateful that the bridge rehabilitation project has been well-received by our host LGUs. Be assured that NLEX Corporation will continue to upgrade its roads to uphold quality standards and most importantly, provide safety and convenience for the public,” he said.

The tollway company appealed for patience and understanding from the public but also gave assurance that efforts will be made to minimize traffic disruption and to provide motorists safer and smoother expressway travel.

Motorists are also advised to plan their trips ahead while allowing for a slightly longer travel time.

NLEX Corporation is a subsidiary of the Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation (MPTC), the toll road arm of the Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC). (PNA)
