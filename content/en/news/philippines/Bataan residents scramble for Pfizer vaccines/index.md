**BALANGA CITY, Bataan** –  An unusually big number of people crowded inoculation sites here Thursday, reportedly caused by the availability of Pfizer vaccines.

Long lines of people as early as 4 a.m. were observed at the Lou-is Resort and Capitol Square mall, designated vaccination areas for residents and the Bataan People’s Center, the inoculation site for residents of the 11 towns.

Nurse Anabella Abella of Balanga City Health Office noted that the situation at the Lou-is Resort was unusual compared to the previous days.

Corazon Federico, who was already at the Capitol Square mall at 8 a.m., said she patiently waited in line because she wants to receive the Pfizer vaccine.

Seventeen-year-old Juliana Santos, a person with comorbidity, who was with her father at the mall, said she did not want to miss the opportunity of being administered with Pfizer.

Zakir Hissain Sikder, a Bangladeshi, and his Filipino wife, came from Mariveles town to be vaccinated at the Bataan People’s Center.

“Nakapila kami 4 a.m. pa. Madaming taong nakapila dahil Pfizer ang bakuna. Ito ang bakunang gusto ko at ayaw ko ng iba (We lined up at 4 a.m. There was a lot of people lining up because of Pfizer. This is the vaccine I want and I do not like others),” Sikder said.

Provincial Health Office (PHO) chief Dr. Rosanna Buccahan said she was surprised by the number of people who trooped to the vaccination center.

Records showed that the Department of Health delivered 7,020 single doses of Pfizer to the PHO and 1,742 single doses of the same vaccine to the Balanga City Health Office last Monday. (PNA)
