**BACOLOD CITY** – Local government officials in Negros Occidental, including this capital city, led their respective constituents in mourning the passing of former President Benigno Simeon Aquino III on Thursday.

The Philippine flag has been flown at half-staff at the Provincial Capitol and the Bacolod City Government Center here, as well as in other cities and municipalities across the province to pay tribute to the man who had served the country as Chief Executive from 2010 to 2016.

Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson said the Negrenses honor and thank Aquino, fondly called "PNoy", for his contributions to the development of Negros Occidental as he acknowledged the accomplishments of his administration.

“The Negros Island will remember the opportunity he gave us to be one region,” he said.

In 2015, Aquino signed Executive Order (EO) 18, creating the Negros Island Region, but it was abolished during the term of President Rodrigo Duterte in 2017 due to lack of funds.

“We acknowledge the accomplishments of his presidency and administration, particularly the advancement of our economy, the change on the perception of other countries with regard to corruption, and the fight for our sovereign rights over the West Philippine Sea,” Lacson said.

He added that “PNoy has been known for his restrained demeanor that translated into his brand of leadership, and this is his legacy.”

In Bacolod, Mayor Evelio Leonardia issued EO 33, series of 2021 ordering to fly the flags at half-staff in all public buildings and places for 10 days or from June 24 to July 3 in mourning the death of Aquino.

“We are giving honor and recognition to former president Aquino for his significant contributions to the country and for his service to the Filipino people,” Leonardia said.

He said the country’s 15th president “leaves behind a selfless dedication to public service for and on behalf of the Filipino people.”

“We lost a statesman, a gentleman, and a visionary, but we are grateful for the legacy he left, an indelible mark of honesty, integrity, and honor, and that the City of Bacolod shall be forever thankful to him for his service to the Filipino people,” Leonardia added. (PNA)
