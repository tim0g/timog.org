**DUMAGUETE CITY** –  The Metro Dumaguete Water (MDW), a joint venture between Metro Pacific Water (MPW) and Dumaguete City Water District (DCWD), has procured three generator sets for its pumping stations in response to the series of regular power outages in the city.

A media release on Thursday said the procurement came as power outages in the city have affected four pumping stations, resulting in low water pressure or lack of water supply in several barangays.

“These generator sets are the first of many investments MDW is making to improve our city’s water services. We hear the public, and whatever we can do quickly to create the improvements we need, we implement, and this is one of them,” MDW chief operating officer David Berba said.

The generators procured by MDW include two new sets and one newly-reconditioned unit.

Derba said the decision to acquire these generator sets is a “prompt response to an apparent problem” as MDW continues to address bigger issues of low pressure and water supply “which takes more study given that the water pipelines’ map itself needs to be updated.”

This measure is aligned with MDW’s ongoing efforts to improve water services in Dumaguete, the media release said.

Last month, a team of independent technical experts arrived in Dumaguete to conduct various tests which would determine the conditions of the pumping stations in the city, it added.

More studies are expected to be made in the coming months to provide a better understanding of Dumaguete’s resources and to help MDW come up with the final blueprint for additional wells and reservoirs. (PNA)
