**MANILA CITY** – There will be several changes and upgrades in public transportation in Metro Manila to help address long queues at the EDSA Busway, transport agencies said on Tuesday.

In a joint statement, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said the plan was brought about by the long lines of commuters reported at the Ortigas and Ayala stations of the EDSA Busway on June 14, noting that there were “unusual circumstances” that led to the event.

“There was heavy rain on Friday, and, according to MMDA (Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), seven vehicular accidents and two stalled vehicular incidents happened along EDSA on Friday, between 2 p.m. to 9 p.m., which contributed to the unusual traffic build-up, and affected the turnaround of EDSA busway units,” the DOTr and LTFRB said.

These were in addition to the 50 percent limited passenger capacity enforced in public transport and the free ride program for health workers and other authorized persons outside of residence at the EDSA Busway.

They noted that the lines to board the MRT-3 at the Ortigas and Ayala stations were normal, and the long lines were only for the EDSA Busway.

“There are now a number of commuters who prefer to take the EDSA Busway rather than the MRT-3 since the ride is free,” the DOTr said.

To avoid similar incidents in the future, DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade has ordered a review of the present free ride program and its possible expansion to other platforms—not limited to road transport.

The EDSA Busway Consortium is also being pushed to deploy the maximum number of authorized bus units under their contract to serve more commuters availing of the free bus ride program, especially during rush hour.

“To date, the consortium pledged to add 15 more modern bus units with left-side doors that will be deployed in the EDSA Busway Route,” the DOTr and LTFRB said.

More transport marshals—for managing passenger traffic—and more “rescue skip buses”—to pick up more passengers during rush hour—will also be deployed.

To further insulate the EDSA Busway from vehicular accidents that occur in other lanes in EDSA, they said more “mini bus loops” will be opened so that buses can “maneuver immediately and fetch passengers.”

“These mini loops shall be monitored and managed by I-ACT (Inter-Agency Council for Traffic), in coordination with MMDA, for smooth flow of traffic,” the DOTr and LTFRB said.

They said the DOTr road sector, the MMDA, and local government units will also meet and discuss other measures to prevent traffic congestion that affect the EDSA Busway.

“We will remain relentless in our pursuit of implementing measures to address transport concerns in EDSA and to provide more transport options such as the EDSA Carousel and an improved MRT-3 system. These will be game-changers in the continuing struggle to give every Filipino commuter a safe and convenient ride home, Friday rush hour or not,” the DOTr and LTFRB said. (PNA)
