**MANILA CITY** –  Malacañang on Tuesday expressed condolences over the passing of Gary Olivar.

In a virtual presser, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Olivar, former economic spokesperson of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, will be missed.

“Nakikiramay po kami sa pamilya, kasamahan sa trabaho at mahal sa buhay ni Mr. Gary Olivar, dati rin pong nagtrabaho dito sa Palasyo bilang Economic Spokesperson ng dating Pangulong Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (We condole with the family, colleagues, and loved ones of Mr. Gary Olivar who also worked at the Palace as economic spokesperson of former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo),” Roque said.

Olivar’s official Facebook account was flooded with condolences from his friends.

His family, however, has yet to issue a formal statement on his death.

Olivar also served as a lead convener of the Department of the Interior and Local Government’s (DILG) Constitutional Reform for Federalism, also known as PDu30 CoRe which pushes for a federal government.

The DILG, in a Twitter post, also mourned the death of Olivar.

“The Department of Interior and Local Government expresses its sincerest condolences to the family of lead Convener of Constitutional Reform for Federalism Secretary Galivar,” it said in its tweet.

Effective communicator

In a separate statement, Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Secretary Martin Andanar hailed Olivar’s performance as a former public servant and as an effective communicator.

“His commitment and exemplary performance in public service, government communications, and information dissemination will truly be valued as we continue to endure and respond to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,” Andanar said.

Andanar also viewed Olivar as Arroyo’s “integral political communicator” on relevant and important public affairs, particularly when the country was facing the impacts of the global economic crisis in 2009.

“We extend our deepest condolences to the family, loved ones, and friends on the passing of former deputy presidential spokesperson Gary Olivar,” he said. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. We pray for the eternal repose of his soul. “

Olivar also worked as a director of the Center for Strategy, Enterprise and Intelligence (CenSEI) which provides strategic research and advisories to select public and private organizations.

On May 14, Olivar said reforming the economic provisions of the 1987 Constitution will attract foreign investments.

Olivar’s statement came amid lawmakers’ bid to introduce reforms to the restrictive economic provisions in the 1987 Constitution.

The House of Representatives on June 1 approved on third and final reading the proposal to amend 1987’s economic provisions to entice more foreign investors. (PNA)
