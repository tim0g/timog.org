<span class="drop">M</span>any things have been said about this university. Many things have been written about what's wrong with it, like the alleged Americanization and the DOW contracts and the very large deficit. But of all that has been said and written, none has made mention of a situation that casts a shadow of doubt on the measure of our institutions as a university and could seriously challenge its claims to excellence.

One of the very obvious—and therefore cry much taken for granted—functions of the university is to serve as a place where minds meet, a place where there is a free intercourse of ideas, where one can integrate the bits of information he has gathered into meaningful and functional knowledge. The inadequacy of our university becomes evident in this aspect. There is no such meeting of minds, no traffic of ideas between the scientists and the non-scientists in this university. There is no evidence at all of any attempt at integration: The scientist and the non-scientist simply cannot understand each other. They do not communicate.

Worse, none has expressed an awareness of this problem. Until very recently.

 
### Neglect

Three issues ago, an English major wrote that science has been neglected in the university. Neglect, meaning dilapidated laboratories equipped with obsolescent apparatus because very little of the P15-lab-fee-per-student really is spent on the laboratories. Neglect, also meaning apathy on the part of the non-scientists—those who are in the arts, social sciences, and humanities, with regard to the needs of the scientists, those in the natural sciences. Take, for example. R.A. 3887, better known as the Natural Science Research Center law, establishing such a center "pursuant to the national policy of promoting scientific research and invention in the Philippines.” 

While in the last campus elections most of the political parties promised to work for its immediate implementation, it would still be too presumptuous for one to consider such pledges as a genuine sign of awareness and concern. For there is more reason to believe that these were merely shrewd political gimmicks aimed at carrying the science votes. The indifference of the non-scientists was best displayed when a rally was staged to demand more concrete action on the establishment of the research center. Only a handful of students—all from the sciences—joined the rally. The non-science students, having ignored the invitation to join the scientists in this cause, were busy "minding their own business,” as if science were not their business.

Yet neglect does not seem to be a very accurate word, for it would appear to lay blame only on the non-scientists and say nothing of the scientists. Which is quite unfair, because the scientists are just as guilty as the non-scientists and both are to blame. Or maybe neither.

 
### Responsible Scientists

We are surprised, for example, how the controversies on the DOW Chemicals and USAF contracts could have passed without a single word of comment from the scientists. Or how such silence could have passed unnoticed by the non-scientists. We can understand—but not necessarily justify—why the scientists would reserve the right to comment on the alleged consent to and participation in a cruel and inhuman and irrational war and American imperialism, which to them may appear trivial and inconsequential. But that was not all there was to the protest. There was also the issue of the manner in which man, through technology, makes use of scientific discoveries and how responsible a scientist is when lives and property are destroyed by the products of his research. On these issues, the scientists cannot afford to be silent. For their silence can only be taken as irrefutable proof of their lack of awareness, and their lack of awareness to mean a lack of responsibility, if not ignorance.

It is perhaps understandable why there is such a mutual I-don't-care attitude. The experiences non-scientists have in the sciences are not exactly very pleasant. These include, among others, noxious fumes from the chem labs, the fishy, nauseating odor from the zoology pavilion, some sleepy lecture hours in a physics class, plus a number of irritating habits of eccentric would-be scientists. The scientists, on the other hand, are reminded of equally traumatic experiences in their non-science classes: uninteresting readings in western thought, uninspiring short stories and meaningless poetry, and the intolerable inaccuracy and unbearable subjectivity of the non-science students and other teachers.

 
### Ivory towers

Or it is highly probable that the scientist-in-ivory-tower mentality still prevails in the university. Long ago, the scientist enjoyed the reputation of one who was quite different from and in fact superior to the rest of humanity. It was believed that his sole responsibility to society was to perform experiments and do scientific research. He was therefore allowed to retreat to some cold, isolated ivory tower where he could best perform his function, undisturbed and uncontaminated by the rest of human activity. For a long time, this arrangement worked. Man took full advantage of the discoveries of the scientist-in-the-ivory-tower and enjoyed all the conveniences made possible by advances in scientific research. And all was well.

The prevalence of this attitude can probably explain the present situation in this university, where there is this mutual mind-your-own-business attitude—where the non-scientists would leave the scientists alone in their ill-lit, poorly ventilated cloisters, where the latter dissect cats and dogfish, or verify physical laws, or contemplate some complex structural formula, refusing to have anything to do with dirty politics, dull literature, and fresh air.

But this concept cannot be justified, nor can it be tolerated. It cannot be tolerated because it is very old and obsolete. And wrong.

In 1945, the atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing thousands of human beings, leaving miles and miles of scorched wasteland, posing a threat of annihilation to mankind. And destroying that ivory tower. After the second world war, the scientists could no longer hide behind their cloak of objectivity and unconcern. For the first time the scientists felt guilt. And as Oppenheimer himself described their feeling of troubled concern, “they have known sin.”

 
### Cooperation

From this guilt came a sense of responsibility. The scientists realized that their responsibility to mankind was not only to make scientific discoveries, but also to prepare man for it, so that he may not use it to destroy himself. It is their responsibility to teach science because science could be taught—to correct the misconceptions of the non-scientists by teaching science as a method, and not as a doctrine, by showing that despite its being a powerful tool, science has its limitations.

The non-scientists, too, have their responsibilities. They should know science and learn it because it could be learned. And because handling a potentially destructive weapon of which one is ignorant ends in self destruction. It is their responsibility, further, to humanize the sciences because the sciences have become dehumanized—and inhumane.

There was therefore a need for communication for a meeting of minds, for a free traffic of ideas between the two, so that they may perform their tasks, and save mankind. This was the lesson man learned a quarter of a century ago, and which we still have to learn now, in this university.
