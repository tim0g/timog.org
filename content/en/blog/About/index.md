Timog is a publicly accessible place where I put stuff for later reference, and to write about random topics, whenever I have the time. 

Also, part of my job is assisting recently arrived Filipinos get used to life in Japan, so there are topics about everyday aspects of life in Japan in the Guide section.

Some other contents are for experimentation and testing, and there will be broken links and unfinished sections where I have left things either intentionally or otherwise.
