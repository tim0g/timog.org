Timog is a publicly accessible place where I put stuff for later reference, and to write about random topics, whenever I have the time. 

There are topics about everyday aspects of life in Japan in the [Guide](https://timog.org/guide/) section, para sa mga Pinoy na kadarating lang sa Japan (kagaya ng mga technical intern trainee).

Other sections are for experimentation and testing, and there will be broken links and unfinished parts where I have left things either intentionally or otherwise.

(For anyone interested, this site was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme. All files are in [Github](https://github.com/) and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).)
