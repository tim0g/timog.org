President Rodrigo Duterte arrived in Japan on Tuesday to a cheering group of Filipinos who welcomed him with open arms.

Speaking before Filipino expatriates in Japan, Duterte said he wanted to make the Philippine economy strong enough so that Filipinos would only go to Japan for vacations - not for work.

He also thanked the Japanese government for providing Filipinos employment and for being the country who has extended the most help to the Philippines

"Bilyon-bilyon ho ang binibigay para makatulong sa ating bayan, kaya...salamat po sa inyo," he said.

*[They have given billions to help our country, so again, thank you.]*

Duterte spoke about his government's campaign to rid the Philippines of drugs and corruption, saying he would be unrelenting in these goals.

"...ako po ay nagsisikap that we will earn more so that by the time, ito ang pangako ko at sana naman sa Diyos at sa inyo na ang pagtrabaho niyo sa labas, hanggang diyan na lang. Next generation, Pilipinas na. So we will do away with so many things. Corruption then drugs," he said.
