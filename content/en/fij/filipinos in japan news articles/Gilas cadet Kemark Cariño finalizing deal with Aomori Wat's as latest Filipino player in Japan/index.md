Kemark Cariño is set to head to Japan B.League's Second Division as an Asian Player Quota import, just finalizing his contract with the Aomori Wat's, according to San Beda team manager Jude Roque.

"He is inclined to accept the offer, but (both sides are) still finalizing the contract," answered Roque to ESPN5 when asked about the next step for the erstwhile Red Lion.

Cariño is presently back inside the Gilas Pilipinas Men's training bubble at the INSPIRE Sports Academy in Calamba, Laguna, where the nationals are gearing up for the FIBA Asia Cup in August.
