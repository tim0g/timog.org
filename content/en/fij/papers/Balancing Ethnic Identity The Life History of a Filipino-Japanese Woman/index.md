The author interviewed a 23 year-old woman who is ethnically “mixed” with Filipino and Japanese heritage. Given that she has been a student and worker both in the Philippines and in Japan, she faces the dilemma of choosing the country in which she feels comfortable enough to settle and call home. In the interview, she expressed her candid opinion about her experiences in the two countries, and her complex feelings in psychologically choosing the place she considers “home.” This study offers an analysis about her life history, and discusses the implications of what it means to be identified as “mixed.” The discussion is based on the ideas of Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995), a Jewish philosopher, who has offered a unique postmodern view about the interpersonal relationship and society.
