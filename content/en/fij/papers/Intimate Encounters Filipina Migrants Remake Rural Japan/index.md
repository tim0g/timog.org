To give a preliminary sense of the kinds of desires that guided Filipina women and Japanese men to their relationships in Central Kiso, I’ll offer two ethnographic sound bites. The first is from a conversation I had in Metro Manila with a woman named Marites, who is the younger cousin of a Filipina friend in Central Kiso. Twenty-four years old at the time, Marites was soon to return to Japan on her sixth six-month contract as an entertainer. She had agreed to an audio-recorded interview about her decision to go to Japan and her work experiences there.

“I just wanted to go,” Marites told me in a mixture of Tagalog and Japanese when I asked her why she had first decided to work in Japan. We were sitting in the small house in Manila that her cousin had built for her mother. Marites told me that she had for some time wanted to go to “America,” but after watching many young women from her neighborhood, including her older cousin, go to Japan as entertainers, she had also grown curious about what life was like there. She had wondered, “When they return to the Philippines, why are they so beautiful? Their hair is colored. They bring bracelets, necklaces. So I was curious. I wanted to go to Japan. Maybe I could be beautiful.”
