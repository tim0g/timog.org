Officially, he works in a *shookokai*. Masao Ihashi-san has worked there for more than twenty five years. In this job, he looks after the socially disadvantaged among commerce and industry workers in Japan, including cases of disadvantaged Filipino migrant workers. He is not unfamiliar about the Philippines, having visited Negros Island in the Visayas earlier. Starting with labor-related problems in the 1980s, he continues to assist Filipino migrants whose problems have expanded beyond their work place to their homes in Japan.

He is considered part of the Filipino community wherever he goes. He is family. He has picked up some Filipino words, has learned to like eating *balut* with San Miguel beer. He seems to enjoy being with Filipinos, be they in trouble or not.

He recently took time off from work and flew to the Philippines with his close friend who is a religious minister. Without any clear itinerary, but trusting some unknown Filipino's advice inside the airplane, they ended up relaxing in the restful, beautiful Visayan island of Boracay for a weekend, both their first long private rest after so many years of fighting for the rights and empowerment of the socially disadvantaged. After that long-delayed much longed for, though brief refresher break, he returned to Japan. His work, like that of his close friend, continues and remains unfinished.
