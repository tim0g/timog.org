In the last three decades since the 1990s through 2010, extensive studies focused on the skewed gender migration pattern of Filipino women to Japan. In recent years, studies focus on Filipino-Japanese descendants, including those referred to as hafu â€”i.e., offspring of intermarried couples. Among intermarried couples, births by Filipino mothers alone rose in the last two decades, from 5,488 in 1995 to 84,345 in 2014. This is significant on account of the total 268,806 births by all foreign mothers (Ministry of Labor and Welfare, E-Stat. 2014) and has considerable impact on a fast-aging society that attempts to avert the effects of low birth rate. Hence, there has been a growing public and academic interests in the discourse.

The article presents findings of an exploratory, ethnographic study focusing on the embodiment of the identity of these offspring as diverse subjects. In particular, the paper highlights three points: a view of the de/construction of the pejoratives and fixities that embody the hafu metaphor (Nitta 1989), the subjects' identity consciousness, and the subjects' evolvement through dynamic appropriation of tangible and intangible social and cultural capital (Bourdieu 1972).
