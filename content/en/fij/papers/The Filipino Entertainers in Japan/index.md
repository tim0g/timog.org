There has been brief literature on the "entertainers" in Japan who come from Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines and Thailand. In fact, this phenomenon of foreign "entertainers" in Japan started with Korean women. Then followed the Taiwanese. More recently, they are mostly from Thailand and the Philippines. What being an "entertainer" means in the present context will  be  discussed in the section two. Some are written by journalists (e.g., Yamatani) and others are written mainly by academicians (e. g., Osteria, Palma-Beltran). They differ widely in their approaches (e. g., collection of personal stories vs. structured surveys) and in the main messages that are intended to be conveyed. In the great majority of these studies the information is collected mainly in Japan and the main focus is what they do while they work in Japan.

This article will take a look at this phenomenon from an originating village's point of view. The main focus here are: Why and how do they become "entertainers"? What do they do with the money they earn back home? How do the other villagers see them? and What is special, if any, about the "entertainers" in Japan compared to other international migrants in other occupations (such as house maids)? We will rely on a small number of life histories drawn from a single village in Pangasinan Province.
