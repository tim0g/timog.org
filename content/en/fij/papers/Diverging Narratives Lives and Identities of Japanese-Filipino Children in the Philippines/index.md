This study focuses on the lives of Japanese-Filipino children who are based in the Philippines, particularly on their identity/ies and social location in the society. One-on-one interviews were conducted by the author with nine respondents. In-depth life history interviews were then carried out with three selected respondents. Using Practice Theory as a framework of analysis, the study reveals that there are different ways that the Japanese-Filipino children craft themselves, mainly because of the different webs of relations that an individual interacts with. This conforms to the concept of identity as being fluid, multifaceted and changing over time. Most importantly, this study reveals a kind of divide that seems to exist between those Japanese-Filipino children who belong to NGOs and those who (refuse) do not belong to any organization. Class appears to play a major role in this divide; a factor that is often overlooked in the existing studies about the Japanese-Filipino children.
