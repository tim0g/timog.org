One gap in the studies on Filipino migrants in Japan is the nonreligious role that the Catholic Church plays, especially in offering them “survival and adaptive strategies”(Mateo 2000).This study aims to fill that gap by focusing on the social services Kyoto Catholic Diocese has for Filipino migrants, which as of 2009 numbered 8,643 in the diocese. Since 1989, the diocese has hosted members of the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception (SFIC) of the Philippines to work as pastoral workers to Filipino migrants.

This paper answers the following question: How does Kyoto Catholic Diocese work with the local government and Japanese NPOs in providing social services to Filipino migrants in Japan? Using the concept of the “third sector” as its framework, this study seeks to 1) know the issues the diocese, local government, and Japanese NPOs work on with regard to Filipino migrants and 2) know the social services the diocese offers Filipino migrants in coordination with the local government and Japanese NPOs.

Archival materials and in-depth interviews reveal that the Sisters have acted as intermediaries to the local government and Japanese NPOs to help Filipino migrants in legal and health concerns. The Sisters also give counseling to Filipinos, especially to those who are married to Japanese men and those who have Japanese-Filipino children. This study sees the value of the Catholic Church as a conduit of social services that helps Filipino migrants integrate into Japanese society.
