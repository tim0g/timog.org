This paper discusses certain bilateral issues and concerns related to the movement of Filipino nurses and caregivers to Japan as provided in the proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Japan and the Philippines also known as the Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement ( JPEPA). Like other industrialized countries, Japan has proposed opening her immigration doors to Filipino nurses and caregivers for their elderly. Already high, the population of Japanâ€™s elderly is expected to rise to 26% in 2015 and to 35.7% in 2050.

The decrease in the number of Japanese care and health providers has been traced to economic (such as low wages, unattractive work conditions for what is considered as a 3K job: *kitsui*, *kiken*, *kitanai*) as well as social factors (such as preference for non-3K jobs, women shifting to non-care professions and jobs, delayed marriage age, nuclearization of Japanese family, among others). Concern for meeting an aging, aged or ultra-aged society , not only for its demographic but economic and social aspects as well, has prompted Japan to propose the import of health and care providers on a trial basis from the Philippines.
