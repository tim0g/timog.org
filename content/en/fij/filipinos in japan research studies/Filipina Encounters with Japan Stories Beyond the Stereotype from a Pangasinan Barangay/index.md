**Authors: Nobuhiko Fuwa and James N. Anderson**

This article focuses on the unfolding lives of eight Filipinas from a barangay in Pangasinan who have worked as Overseas Performing Artists (OPAs) or are wives of Japanese men. Their life stories, as told during interviews conducted in the Philippines and in Japan between 1994 and 2004, were enhanced with information on their families collected through four decades of research since 1961.

The article describes similarities and differences among the women as individuals and their strategies in dealing with the challenges of work and responses to the duality of cultural demands. These stories put to question some common but overgeneralized descriptions and suppositions about Filipina OPAs.
