"**Toyang**" is a song by Filipino rock band [Eraserheads](../eraserheads), from their debut album *[UltraElectroMagneticPop!](../ultraelectromagneticpop)*. Written by [Ely Buendia](../ely-buendia) and [Marcus Adoro](../marcus-adoro), it is the band's second hit single.

The song is notable for featuring creative wordplay and idiosyncratic combinations: the narrator is speaking of his love for simplicity and for Toyang, a bright-eyed Filipina, through a classic English love song, several Filipino folk songs, and Ilocano poetry. It references the Paul McCartney-penned "Silly Love Songs", the first two lines of the song as well as the pun on Toyang's name is from "Too Young" (a composition written by Sylvia Dee and Sidney Lippman which was well known for Nat King Cole's rendition), and it takes inspiration from Filipino folk songs such as "Pen Pen de Sarapen", a popular rhyming song used in children's games, and "Bahay Kubo" (Nipa Hut).

## Lyrics

They try to tell us where too young\
Too young to really be in love

**[Refrain]**\
Bahay namin maliit lamang\
Pero pero pero malinis 'to pati sa kusina\
Kumain man kami laging sama-sama

Pen-pen-pen de sarapen\
De kutsilyo de almasen\
Haw-haw-haw de karabaw\
De karabaw de batuten

Pengeng singko pambilbi ng puto\
Sa mga tindera ng bitsu-bitsu\
Skyflakes, Coke-500 pahingi ng kiss\
Pambayad lang sa jeepney kulang pa ng diyes

**[Chorus]**\
Mahal ko si Toyang\
’Pagkat siya’y simple lamang\
Kahit namumrublema\
Basta’t kami ay magkasama

Madalas man kaming walang pera\
Makita lang ang kislap ng kanyang mga mata\
Ako ay busog na\
At nakatambay kami sa Tandang Sora

*Ti ayat ti masya nga baro*\
*Ken balasang nataina*\
*Uray man uray man uray man*\
*Haan unay nga nadonya*

*(Refrain) (Chorus)*

We were not too young at all wohh...
