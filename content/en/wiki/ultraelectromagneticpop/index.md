***Ultraelectromagneticpop!*** (officially written and stylized as ultraelectromagneticpop!) is the debut studio album of the Filipino alternative rock band [Eraserheads](../eraserheads), released by BMG Records (Pilipinas), Inc. in 1993. Ultraelectromagneticpop! spawned hit songs such as "Ligaya", "Toyang", and "Pare Ko". The album brought the underground Philippine college rock scene into public awareness and the emergence of "Eraserheadsmania" because of successive hit singles and sold-out concerts.

## Background

Though *Ultraelectromagneticpop!* was their debut album, most of the songs were recycled from original compositions that were written since their college days in 1989. Hoping to have their songs published, the band recorded a demo tape in 1991 and shopped around record labels and radio stations, only to be rejected at every turn. A friend-professor, Robin Rivera, from their school, UP Diliman, helped them record an improved version of the demo tape which was named Pop U!, a play on the invective "fuck you," in response to the people who turned them down. After a year of being passed around the underground music scene, the demo tape made its way to the hands of BMG Records (Philippines), who signed a three-year contract with the band.

The title of the album is a pun on ultraelectromagnetic tops, a fictional weapon from the anime serial Voltes V, which was immensely popular in the Philippines.

## Recording

The recording of *Ultraelectromagneticpop!* started on July 1992 to April 1993 with crazy working titles like "Lutong Bahay", "Pekaloid", "The Klasik Kapums Konsert Kookout", and "Eraserheads Greatest Hits Vol. 5". at Ad & Ad Recording Studio and JR Recording Studio.

Based on their production notes, they somewhat had a hard time during their recording sessions. It was stated that there are two things on their recording sessions : Heaven and Hell.

Hell: Ac and Ad. Brownouts, floods, rain, wait ancient equipment, No DAT, Ed Formoso, master recording machine kept slowing down and breaking up.

Heaven: JR Recording. Groovy engineer, Mr. Willie (the screen) Munji. Freedom! Experimentation. Everything we wanted. Good food, sound, equipment (d-drums! effects! sofa!)

## Release

The album was released by BMG Records (Pilipinas) under the label's local division, Musiko Records in July 1993. The album was originally issued on both compact disc and cassette tape formats with the respective catalog numbers: MRCD-032 and MRMC-032. Original issue cassettes featured full-color sticker labels on both sides.

In 2008, the album was re-released together with the band's other albums.

### 25th anniversary remastered version

Notes

- "Pare Ko" and "Walang Hiyang Pare Ko" are actually the same song. The latter is a clean, radio-friendly version of the former.
- "Walang Hiyang Pare Ko" does not appear on the 2018 remastered version of the album.
- Toyang" was slightly inspired by "Too Young," a composition written by Sylvia Dee and Sidney Lippman which was well known for Nat King Cole's rendition. The song also makes reference to several Filipino folk songs and as well as the Paul McCartney-penned "Silly Love Songs". Buendia's inspiration behind the song was his then long time college girlfriend, Victoria Cayago.
- "Ganjazz" was a jazz version of "Honky-Toinks Granny" and was recorded with Jojo Bacasmas on vocals.
- "Honky-Toinks Granny" was a country version of "Ganjazz".
- The album has a modified version of the Parental Advisory sticker in the cover art of the original release (see infobox). It reads:
- "Parental Advisory: Some songs may not be suitable for children (but there isn't anything in this album that your kids haven't heard before!)"
- The Parental Advisory is removed in the 25th Anniversary edition cover.
