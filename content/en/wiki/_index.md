If your project has an API, configuration, or other reference - anything that users need to look up thatâ€™s at an even lower level than a single task - put (or link to it) here. You can serve and link to generated reference docs created using Doxygen,
Javadoc, or other doc generation tools by putting them in your `static/` directory. Find out more in [Adding static content](https://docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/content/#adding-static-content). For OpenAPI reference, Docsy also provides a [Swagger UI layout and shortcode](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/shortcodes/#swaggerui) that renders [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) using any OpenAPI YAML or JSON file as source.
