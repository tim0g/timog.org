**Raimund Emmanuel Parcon Marasigan** (born May 22, 1971) is a Filipino rock musician and record producer. His first name is often misspelled Raymond or Raimond though he personally prefers to spell his name as Raymund. The breadth of his projects has made him one of the most well-respected mainstays of the Philippine rock band scene. He was the drummer, vocalist and lyricist alongside bandmate [Ely Buendia](../ely-buendia) of the [Eraserheads](../eraserheads), and the current keyboard/synths player for Pedicab, former rhythm guitarist and now frontman of Sandwich, current drummer of Cambio, vocalist of Project 1 and the man behind Squid 9. Currently, he holds bass for his newest band, Gaijin. Aside from writing songs and being a musician, he is also a record producer, voice actor, TV host and product endorser.

## Eraserheads

He first achieved fame as drummer for the rock band Eraserheads, one of the most popular Philippine bands of the 1990s. He played the drums, provided backing vocals, and occasionally sang on lead vocals. Marasigan's songwriting output for the Eraserheads was only next to that of its principal songwriter Ely Buendia.

In 2002, vocalist-guitarist Ely Buendia left the Eraserheads, and Kris Dancel from the all-female band Fatal Posporos was recruited to fill the vacancy. The group billed themselves as Eheads and issued an EP entitled *Please Transpose* (2003). The group later renamed themselves Cambio after their lead guitarist Marcus Adoro quit. Cambio released two albums: *Derby Light* (2003) and *Matic* (2007).

On August 30, 2008 at the Fort Bonifacio Open Grounds in Taguig, Marasigan joined Buendia, [Adoro](../marcus-adoro), and [Zabala](../buddy-zabala) for The Eraserheads reunion concert. The continuation of the reunion "The Final Set" was held on March 7, 2009 at the SM Mall of Asia concert grounds.

## Sandwich

The band Sandwich was formed in 1995 with Myrene Academia (Imago) & (Duster) on bass, Marc Abaya on lead guitars and vocals later replaced by Mong Alcaraz of Chicosci on guitars when the former quit to focus on being an MTV mainstay, Diego Castillo on rhythm guitars, and Mike Dizon (of bands Pedicab and Teeth) on drums. Although existing simultaneously with the Eraserheads, Sandwich provided a heavier, grittier sound, and built up their own fan base. Marc Abaya left the band in 2005 to concentrate on his career as a VJ while frontlining for his other band Kjwan and Marasigan took over as the lead vocalist. They have released three albums: *Grip Stand Throw* and *4-Track Mind* (later reissued as a 2-in-1 by Sony BMG, and 2004's award-winning *Thanks to the Moon's Gravitational Pull* (initially an indie release; then later reissued by EMI Philippines with bonus tracks. Sandwich released further albums, entitled *Five on the Floor* (2006) which featured the phenomenal hit single, Sugod, and *S Marks the Spot* (2008), with its hit single *Procrastinator* and *Betamax*.

## Pedicab

In early 2005, Marasigan once again formed Pedicab, another project band. Composed of seasoned artists donning alter egos; Raymund (a.k.a. Sugarraims) is on synths and backup vocals; Mike Dizon (of Sandwich and Teeth) a.k.a. Masterbeat is on drums; Jason Caballa (of Twisted Halo and Blast Ople) a.k.a. J. Sonic is on guitar and backup vocals; Diego Mapa (of Monsterbot and Cambio) a.k.a. Daddy Maps is lead vocals; and acclaimed music video director RA Rivera a.k.a. Just Toni is on visuals and multimedia. They call their music "dunk music" which is essentially their own version of Dance-punk. They released a two-track sampler called "For Hire" with tracks "Bago Pa Mag Pasko" and "Pa-Experience". Pedicab's first album Tugish Takish (the name coming from onomatopoeia of the sounds made by banging on drums) under Vicor music was released later that year. Tugish Takish has spawned hits such as "Dito Tayo Sa Dilim", "Dizzy Boy", "Konti Na Lang" and "A Stormy Night". Their second album "Shinji Ilabas Mo Na Ang Helicopter" with carrier single "Ang Pusa Mo" was released in April 2008 under MCA Records Philippines. Their second album also contains the remake of "Pa-Experience" which they retitled to "Pa-Taste". It also has fan favorites such as "FX", "Follow Through", and "Breaking Away".

## Project 1

In 2008, Marasigan launched his new album with Sandwich, after that, he also launched a one-shot band called "Project 1" with Clem Castro (former Orange and Lemons, now The Camerawalls) on guitars, Francis Reyes (The Dawn) also on guitars, Carlos Calderon (Chicosci) on bass, Jazz Nicolas (Itchyworms) on drums and Uela Basco (Chilitees), Katwo Librando (Narda/Duster) and Marasigan himself on vocals. Their first single "Ang Sarap Dito" was released in March 2008. According to its members, "The new group was formed because we, as artists, feel that we wanted to create something fresh, especially for the young generation. We all believe in a common goal of being positive and changing the way young people think." Their first and only single was used by Coca-Cola Philippines for television and radio commercials and also by Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus.
