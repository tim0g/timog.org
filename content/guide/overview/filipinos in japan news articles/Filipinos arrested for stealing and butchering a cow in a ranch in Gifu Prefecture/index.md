The Kamo Police Station of the Gifu Prefectural Police arrested two Filipino men on suspicion of illegal entry and theft after they entered a ranch in Sakahogi Town in Gifu Prefecture and stole one beef cattle (equivalent to a market value of 700,000 yen).

A cow with its head and right front leg cut off has been found outside the fence of the ranch. 

The Kamo police station is also investigating the alleged violation of the Act on Welfare and Protection of Animals, alleging that the men killed the cow and tried to take away its head.

The two arrested were the self-proclaimed Filipino national unemployed Garindo Oswald Alemania (46) and the unemployed Alemania John Ol Resurrecion (27), who live in Minokamo City of the same prefecture.

The dead cow is a 4 year and 11 month old female, about 1.8 meters long and weighing about 500 kilograms. The head was found about 100 meters away from the ranch, but the right front leg was not found. The butchered cow was one of four cows in the ranch.

According to the Kamo Police Station, a police officer on patrol on the streets of Minokamo City called out to both suspects around 4 AM on July 31, but Alemania escaped. The bicycle of Garindo, who remained, had blood on it, and during investigation the manager of the ranch reported that "the cow seems to be dead and in the process of being dismembered."

Both suspects were alleged to have colluded and illegally entered the ranch in Sakahogi Town from 1:00 am to 4:00 am on the 31st, and stole a cow.
