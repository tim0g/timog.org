  Struggles of Filipino women married to Japanese men living in rural Japan
---
**Author: Yoshimi Umeda**

This is a study of forty Filipina women married to Japanese men living in a rural farming district in northern Japan. The thesis is concerned with four main areas of enquiry: the initial adjustment of the Filipinas to their new environment; their performance of local gender roles; the religious practices that the women carry out; and the social activities in which they participate. It is an account of the difficulties individuals face and the adjustments they have to make when they decide to settle in a foreign country.  It is also an account of the problems of 'accommodation' experienced by Filipinas encountering Japanese society.

The difficulties that the women face in their marital lives and the way in which they deal with them indicate both particular characteristics of Japanese society and certain qualities of Filipino personhood. By looking at a transnational experience from this perspective, the thesis attempts to trace the contours of the dynamic interaction between the Filipinas and the Japanese, on the one hand, and between forces of social reproduction and individual choices, on the other.
