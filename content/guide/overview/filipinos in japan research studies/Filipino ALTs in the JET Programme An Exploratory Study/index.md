Since the Philippines has been included in the group of countries eligible to send Assistant Language Teachers (ALTs) through the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme in 2014, the number of Filipino ALTs has dramatically increased. While studies have been conducted on the profile, motivations and contributions of Filipino ALTs to Japanese society, there are only two that exist to date, and the focus on those hired by local Boards of Education and private dispatch companies. In order to fill gaps in literature, this exploratory sociological study of Filipino ALTs participating in the JET Programme was conducted. It attempted to provide a description of the Filipinos chosen to take part in the said programme.

In addition, it aimed to identify and analyze the motivations behind their decision to move to Japan and work as ALTs. Data was collected from August to September of 2019, through semi-structed interviews with a total of 17 Filipino ALTs. Interviews were then transcribed and coded through a general inductive approach. As this study is still in its preliminary stages, the report focused only on personal data and key themes that emerged in the first two readings of the transcripts, which were then compared with existing literature in order to identify similarities and differences with their non-JET counterparts.
