- The MHLW has collaborated with the COVID-19 Response Technology Team in the development of the COVID-19 Contact-Confirming Application (COCOA*) to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Use this application after downloading it on your smartphone.

- This application enables users to receive notifications about possible contact with positive COVID-19 cases after approval from the individual user by utilizing the short-range communication function (Bluetooth) on smartphones. It ensures privacy by preventing users from identifying each other.

- Users can receive quick support from local public health centers, including test visits, if they know that they might have been in contact with positive cases. The more users use this app, the more effectively it will help prevent the spread of infection.

## Installing the app
