**Note:** If you decide not to cancel your current passport at the time of application, you will need to buy:

- 2 Letterpack Plus envelopes (1 self-addressed envelope that you will submit during the application, and 1 to send your current passport to the Consular Section when your new passport is ready)
- 1 self-addressed postcard to submit during application

See the note on the [how to renew your passport](../how-to-renew-passport-philippine-embassy-tokyo/#2-prepare-the-necessary-documents).

520-yen Letterpack Plus (red) envelopes and postcards (hagaki) are sold in Post Offices and convenience stores, although some branches might not have them. 

Write the numbers and letters clearly. Japanese mailmen are not so familiar reading addresses in Romaji so you might want to make their work easier by writing in big, clear characters.

## Write your name and address

- Postal code
- Complete address down to the **apartment number**
- Your name (last name and first name is enough)
- Phone number (only on the Letterpack Plus)

Actually, you write your address and name *vertically* on postcards but it might not be practical with Romaji, having lots of letters.

## Take a picture of the Letterpack tracking number

This is important.

Knowing the tracking number of the Letterpack Plus will let you know if it has already been mailed from the Embassy, and where is it at the present.

You can input the number at the [Japan Post website](https://www.post.japanpost.jp/index_en.html) to track your passport.
