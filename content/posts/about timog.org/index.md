Timog is a publicly accessible place where I put stuff for later reference, and to write about random topics, whenever I have the time. 

There are topics about everyday aspects of life in Japan in the [Guide](https://timog.org/guide/) section, *para sa mga Pinoy na kadarating lang sa Japan (kagaya ng mga technical intern trainee)*.

Other sections are for experimentation and testing, and there will be broken links and unfinished parts where I have left things either intentionally or otherwise.

### Technical stuff

I wanted to build a simple site in plain html files without the need for a CMS so I used a static site generator. Hugo is perfect for this purpose. All files are in Github and deployed using Netlify.

<td>Markdown editors</td>
<td><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSC</a></td>
</tr>
</table>

I originally made this site with the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme, but I finally moved to Hugo Flex. I like the simplicity of Hugo Flex: minimalist design, lightweight, no framework, no Javascript.

For editing markdown files, I use Notepad++ and Visual Studio Code, whichever is present on the machine I'm using. Although I feel N++ is faster than VSC, I find changing color themes in N++ harder than necessary so I find myself using VSC if I want a dark color theme and N++ for a light theme.

I want to make the index page as lightweight and responsive as possible so images are not displayed on the homepage. Clicking on the post title will take you to the individual post's permalink, where images are displayed.
