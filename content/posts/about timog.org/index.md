Timog is a publicly accessible place where I put stuff for later reference, and to write about random topics, whenever I have the time. 

There are topics about everyday aspects of life in Japan in the [Guide](https://timog.org/guide/) section, *para sa mga Pinoy na kadarating lang sa Japan (kagaya ng mga technical intern trainee)*.

Other sections are for experimentation and testing, and there will be broken links and unfinished parts where I have left things either intentionally or otherwise.

### Technical stuff

I wanted to build a simple site in plain html files without the need for a CMS so I used a static site generator. Hugo is perfect for this purpose. All files are in Github and deployed using Netlify.

<td>Static site generator</td>

<td>Markdown editors</td>
<td><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSC</a></td>
</tr>
</table>

I originally made this site with the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme, but I finally moved to Hugo Flex for its simplicity: minimalist design, lightweight, no framework, no Javascript.

For editing markdown files, I use Notepad++ and Visual Studio Code, whichever is present on the machine I'm using. Although I feel N++ is faster than VSC, I find changing color themes in N++ harder than necessary so I find myself using VSC if I want a dark color theme and N++ for a light theme.
