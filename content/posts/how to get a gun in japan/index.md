Paminsan-minsan, kung mapapadaan ka sa medyo probisyang lugar ng Japan, may mapapansin kang mga Gun-Hunting Prohibited Area na sign.

Para sa mga taong nasanay na na hindi makakita ng baril sa Japan (bawal humawak ng baril pati mga security guard), baka nakakabiglang malaman na *pwedeng* makakuha ng baril sa Japan.

Pero ang [proseso ay napakakumplikado](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/), hindi siguro magandang investment ng oras at pera, puwera na lang kung gusto mong kumain ng sarili mong huli na baboy damo o wild duck.

Ayon sa [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/02/world/international-gun-laws.html), ito ang proseso ng pagkuha ng lisensya ng baril sa Japan.

1. Join a hunting or shooting club.
2. Take a firearm class and pass a written exam, which is held up to three times a year.
3. Get a doctorâ€™s note saying you are mentally fit and do not have a history of drug abuse.
4. Apply for a permit to take firing training, which may take up to a month.
5. Describe in a police interview why you need a gun.
6. Pass a review of your criminal history, gun possession record, employment, involvement with organized crime groups, personal debt and relationships with friends, family and neighbors.
7. Apply for a gunpowder permit.
8. Take a one-day training class and pass a firing test.
9. Obtain a certificate from a gun dealer describing the gun you want.
10. Buy a gun safe and an ammunition locker that meet safety regulations.
11. Allow the police to inspect your gun storage.
12. Pass an additional background review.
13. Buy a gun.

Dahil sa ganitong estriktong proseso ng pagkuha ng baril na bunga ng Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law ("No one shall possess a firearm or firearms or a sword or swords."), halos [walang namamatay dahil sa baril](https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-control-how-japan-has-almost-completely-eliminated-gun-deaths-2017-10) sa Japan.

Needless to say, hindi ka rin puwedeng maglakad-lakad sa publiko nang may sukbit na katana.
