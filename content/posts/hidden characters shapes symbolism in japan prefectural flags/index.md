![Prefectural flags of Japan collage](prefectural-flags-of-japan.png "Prefectural flags of Japan by [The_Irish_Jet](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/i7qqpl/flags_of_all_japanese_prefectures/).")

I recently collected all the prefectural flags of Japan for a project, and here they are below in rasterized form, alphabetically arranged.

Most are formed by stylized hiragana and katakana (and even kanji) and shapes of prominent geographical features and symbols, which may not be obvious on first observation. 

Embarrassingly, I didn't even realise until recently that the emblem of [Ibaraki](#ibaraki-茨城) (where I live) is a stylized rose bud.

I like simple, uncluttered design. Besides Ibaraki, my other favorites are [Fukuoka](#fukuoka-福岡), [Hokkaidō](#hokkaidō-北海道), [Kyōto](#kyōto-京都), [Nagasaki](#nagasaki-長崎), [Saga](#saga-佐賀), and [Shizuoka](#shizuoka-静岡).

## Aichi 愛知
Aichi's flag combines あ (a), い (i), and　ち (chi) to form a design representing the overseas development of the prefecture facing the Pacific Ocean and the hopeful Rising Sun Wave Crest.

## Akita 秋田
The Akita flag features a dynamically stylized katakana ア (a) from its name, representing the progress and development of the prefecture. A striking design by an anonymous creator, it vaguely resembles the Nike logo, which it precedes by more than ten years.
