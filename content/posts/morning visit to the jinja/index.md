This morning I threw out the garbage, took pictures of poppies and moss along the road, found myself in front of the neighborhood *jinja*, took a moment to remember my departed Mother, watched the birds and ducks on the rice paddies on the way back to the house, and then went out again to buy bread from the nearby bakery.

It was a good way to start the day.
