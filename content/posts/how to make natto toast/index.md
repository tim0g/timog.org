I sometimes need to scavenge the inside of the refrigerator for a quick bite and for some reason, there's always left-over bread and nattō lying around somewhere.

Here's how to make a protein-rich, tasty toast using this traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans. The flavor vaguely reminds me of [vegemite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegemite) sandwich.

### 1. Toast a slice of raisin bread

Ordinary bread would do too, but raisins in the bread give more flavor especially when combined with nattō.

### 2. Spread nattō on top

Of course, you have to mix the nattō first until you get a spidery web all over.

### 3. Top it off with a sprinkle of chopped onions

Completely optional. Most of the time only the nattō is enough.
