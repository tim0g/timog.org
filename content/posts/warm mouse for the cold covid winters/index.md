Due to the ongoing Covid pandemic, workplaces everywhere in Japan are required to have enough ventilation to prevent the virus from concentrating in [closed spaces](https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/12/12/the-japanese-authorities-understood-covid-19-better-than-most). Which means much colder workplaces in the winter.

And with the winter in full swing, our office feels frigid, with exhaust fans on, doors open and the air-conditioning system not powerful enough to cope.

The mouse I use in the office feels especially cold to the touch so after a little bit of searching around, I bought this [heated mouse](https://www.amazon.co.jp/USB%E6%8E%A5%E7%B6%9A-3%E8%89%B2LED%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88-%E9%AB%98%E7%B2%BE%E5%BA%A6%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B2%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0-4%E6%AE%B5%E8%AA%BF%E7%AF%80%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BDDPI-5%E3%83%9C%E3%82%BF%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AB/dp/B083J6B2SQ) (暖かいマウス) from Amazon for JPY1,899. I actually kind of surprised that heated mouse is not a common PC accessory in temperate countries: mouse makers like Logitech and Microsoft, or Elecom and Buffalo in Japan don't sell them.

So is it warm? It's advertised as warming to 41 to 55°C and it certainly feels warm in my hand, even sometimes getting too hot to touch. I expect a mouse to work for at least 3 years and only time would tell if this mouse would last that long.
