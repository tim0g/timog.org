For me, Spitz's *Hachimitsu* album *is* Japanese pop. I don't know any other.

I had mentioned Spitz once when my friend Marc and I were talking about Japanese pop and he said, have you listened to [Hachimitsu](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%81%E3%83%9F%E3%83%84_(%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%90%E3%83%A0))? So I got one.

I've had this album since the 1990s and have listened to it countless times. And if I recall correctly, this is the only J-pop album that I have ever owned.

The first Hachimitsu CD I had was lost when I moved all my music to digital, but I bought a new one when I decided I really wanted my music [on compact discs](../why-i-went-back-to-music-cds/), not mp3s.

So to break the monotony of jazz and classical music, whenever I want to listen to pop music--Japanese pop music--I put Hachimitsu on. The music takes me to a simpler, more carefree time.
