I visited Narita Airport again recently pre-Omicron and it was so much vibrant than [before](https://timog.org/photos-of-an-eerily-empty-narita-airport/), with a new, cheerful Christmas motif to boot. Covid infections in Japan were near record lows, entry restrictions were scrapped and everyone was looking forward to a happy ending to a dreadful year.

And then [Omicron happened](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/02/world/south-africa-omicron-origins-covid-cmd-intl/index.html).

Anyway, enjoy these cheerful Christmas-themed ornaments. It was fun while it lasted.

Lively Christmas designs greet travelers at Narita Airport on late November, before the Omicron variant of the coronavirus was first reported in South Africa.

Inventions associated with flying are prominently featured together with Christmas ornaments.

"May this Christmas end the year on a cheerful note and make way for a fresh and bright new year."

"I hope things get back to normal soon." For a while, things *were* getting back to normal.

The airport was brighter and had so much more people than [before](https://timog.org/photos-of-an-eerily-empty-narita-airport/). Things were looking good--[until they weren't](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/11/29/national/japan-omicron-entry-restrictions/).
