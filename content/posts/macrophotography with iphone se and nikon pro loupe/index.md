I wanted to take photos of flowers with a smartphone but I don't want to upgrade my iPhone SE (2nd generation) just yet for an iPhone 13 Pro, which looks like it could take [impressive macro shots](https://timog.org/iphone-macro-photography/) from as close as 2 centimeters away.

After considering cheap clip-on macro lenses, it occured to me to try an old Nikon loupe (a [Nikon 4x Pro-Loupe](/macrophotography-with-iphone-se-and-nikon-pro-loupe/nikon-4x-pro-loupe.jpg) that I have had since I was shooting slide film, which really was a long time ago).

My results have been really satisfactory.

Taking photos with this set-up is simple: I set the iPhone's camera to half-way zoom, place the loupe just in front of the camera lens, and shoot away. It sounds more cumbersome than it actually is.

Here are some photos that I took using this smartphone-loupe combination.
