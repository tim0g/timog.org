In case you forget to bring a photocopy of your [passport for renewal](../how-to-renew-passport-philippine-embassy-tokyo) at the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo, or you need to photocopy documents in a hurry for other purposes, there's a photocopy machine on the 2nd floor of the **Azabu District Minato Ward Office**.

It is about 180 meters (about 2-minute walk) from the entrance of the Consular Section. Walk to the right side as you exit the Consular Section, turn right at the T-intersection and the entrance to the ward office is on the right, about 100 meters from the bend.
