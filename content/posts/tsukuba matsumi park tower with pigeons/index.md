Every college student biking from [Tsukuba Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukuba_Station) to the [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) gets to have a peek at this [strangely shaped](https://dailyportalz.jp/b/cs/mitekite/detail/080219057745/1.htm) observation tower in Matsumi Park that is affectionately called Bottle Opener Tower (栓抜き塔) by the locals.

Pigeons above and koi below, Matsumi Park used to be the place to feed the birds and fish but recently feeding these animals have been banned.
