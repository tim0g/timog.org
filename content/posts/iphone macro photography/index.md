I have had a number of SLR macro lenses from Contax, Tamron and Olympus throughout the years but doing macrophotography with something like my current iPhone SE is a little tricky, if not impossible.

iPhone SE's portrait mode lets me have at least some *bokeh* in my photos to minimize distracting backgrounds, but Apple's recent [iPhone Macro Challenge](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/04/apple-unveils-the-best-photos-from-the-shot-on-iphone-macro-challenge/) shows what kind of amazing photos can be created if one is willing to spend tens of thousands of yen for their flagship iPhone 13 Pro series.
