Because of Covid, dividers were erected on the tables in the company canteen and the seating was adjusted so that no two people face each other while having a meal. Alternate seats were attached with the following sign:

"Kochira no oseki wa goriy≈ç itadakemasen"

Which everybody just paid a little attention to because it just means you can't use this chair, use another.

So I did, until I glanced on this sign again while eating curry rice one day and realized we, being students of Japanese, could learn a lot of things from this short sentence.

The simplest polite form of this sentence may be "Kono isu wa tsukaemasen."
