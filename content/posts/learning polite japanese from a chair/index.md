Because of Covid, dividers were erected on the tables in the company canteen and seating was adjusted so that no two people face each other while having a meal. Alternate seats were attached with the following sign:

<p style="text-align:center;line-height:3;font-family:sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:1.2rem; color:#000;border:3px solid #333;padding:10px">こちらのお席はご利用いただけません</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic">Kochira no oseki wa goriyō itadakemasen</p>

Which everybody paid a little attention to because it simply means you can't use this chair, use another (there couldn't be any other meaning).

So I did, until I glanced on this sign again while eating curry rice one day and realized that we, being students of Japanese, could learn a lot of things from this short sentence.

The simplest polite form of this sentence may be "Kono isu wa tsukaemasen."
